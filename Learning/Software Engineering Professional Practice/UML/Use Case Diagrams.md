# Use Case Diagrams
These offer a way to show all the use cases in a system and is part of [[UML]]. They are easy to understand which makes them useful for communicating with stakeholders. In this **actors** are stick figures, **use cases** are named ovals and possible **interaction** between actors and use case as lines connecting them.

We usually link the primary actor to the use case. Then multiple actors can interact with the same use case.
