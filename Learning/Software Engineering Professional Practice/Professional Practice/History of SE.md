# History of SE
It was in 1935 when software first came about. Later software engineering came out when we had to distinguish between this and hardware development (in apollo). Software crisis came about when size and complexity grew. in 1960-. In 1970-1990s  software was meant to be custom one-off long life systems. **Software projects** were set up to design such systems with development companies paid to develop systems that follows documented requirements and maintenance/change. Plan-driven [[Processes]] were developed for this that have a lot of overhead but ensure the design specification is met.

Generic software replaced specific software since it was cheaper and faster to get. Dissatisfaction with plan-driven approach also changed. In response software development companies developed generic software products and control implementation and lifetime. The customer would then buy the product once released. This lead to Agile [[Processes]] which develops fast rather than looking at long terms solutions.

Project vs Product: Projects come from external customers from comes from contract document and the developers maintain the project after development. All is decide and paid by the customer. Products come from the development company when they see a opportunity in the market. The life and changes are decided by developer. Then the development is influenced by users. The main difference in external customer vs company doing the developing. These can be mixed an matched though.

## Execution Models
There can be different execution models for software (enabled by high speed networking). 
#### Stand Alone
This is where the SD company releases updates the user then installs them.
#### Software as a Service
The user connects to the vendor's servers where all the work is actually done the user then just gets an output in their browser.
#### Hybrid model
User interfaces with program which is partially functional as it goes along. Additional functionality available from vendors servers as well as data storage and updates.

Another change since early development years is the development of many libraries. So making software is all about reusability and we adapt it to each application domain. There are also *reuse-based* development processes which are a mix between agile and plan based.
