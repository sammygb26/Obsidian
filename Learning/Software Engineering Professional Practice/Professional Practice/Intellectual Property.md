# Intellectual Property
The idea here is that we have property that isn't truly something real, but that still have value. Another name for this is **IP**. It is the result of a **creative activity**. It is protected my intellectual properties rights. There are IPRs that permit or restrict their party rights to use an IP then there are IPRs that give monopoly rights to the creator.

## Ownership of IP
There are different ideas of who owns IP. For an example an employer can own an employees intellectual property that they create at the company. This will be specified under a contract. You wouldn't expect your employer to take IP form your free time. IP can also be shared between people. You can also get background and foreground IP that is background is what you are building on top of and foreground is what you make.

## Rights to Protect IP
There are different ways to protect IP. Ideas aren't protected under IP

## Copyright
This is an IPR that is created automatically. It is very old and based on books, art etc. The idea is you have the right to make copies and display your own work. It is primarily based on things that can be written down and copied. Computer programs are considered to be literary work as this is text.

There are **infringing acts** that count as breaking copyright. Some examples are Copying the Work, Issuing Copies of the Work to the Public, Rental Lending the Work to the Public, Performing the Work in Public, Communicating the Work, Adapting the Work. 

There can also be **permitted acts** for example educational copying, or decomplication of Computer Programs is permitted if you need to do so. There is also Fair dealing where you don't have a commercial edge you don't make money out of it. You can reproduce for private use for example this can also apply to reporting on works.

## Copyright and Computer Programs
Copyright protection was extended to computer programs in 1992m in the US it is the authors like plus 70 years. To infringe on this you have to copy a "substantial part" of the program that is a unique part that is related to the product. You can copy lawfully like making back ups, de-compiling to make non-working versions.  You can correct errors, you can observe or study how the program works. You should know the agreement to know what you can do.

#### Internet
This complicates it all for example linking to other products. Then how should research interface with all this. There are also problems with YouTube for example allow people to upload infringing videos who is responsible.

#### Databases
Databases have protection for the **structure** and **contents** of a database. The database has a right for people to not access a database or at least too much of it. You can't **extract** to much, **re-utilize** make it available else where, **protection lasts 15 years**.

# Open-Source
Here we have many people voluntarily putting in work to a product. The developers have the right to what is done with the software the develop at least. Now huge parts made in open source now make large amounts of money. The idea is **open source** is an idea of legal risk this is due to open source borrowing code from 3rd parties. If you buy a product the vendor takes responsibility for IP but this may not be the case when using open source. This gives a **need for licensing**.

**Source code** -> The many product of a software house. Program code which a skilled programmer can read. Key modifications need to be made as development goes on. One key idea is having access even then a vendor closes. Here the code can be stored in the code escrow so that it is always available if you bought it.

When you use software there is a license that describes what can be done with the IP.

**Open-source** is far cheaper than regular licensed software. Open-source is just another license however. The idea is there is full-access to the source code and you can modify and share the code. There is little warranty protection however. The risks of using OS is that you could accidentally infringe on code. The license agreement and specify who is responsible for this. There can also be risks on **onward exploitation** that is going forward what do you have the right to do with software you develop. For example some open source licenses make it illegal to sell what you have made with the open source software to keep it open.

# Software Patents
These are granted to ideas instead of actual work. You can patent an idea and the patent holder has a monopoly on the use of the patent. One example is drug companies having patents on drugs, so only they can produce the drug. Patents have to be registered at a patent office if it is accepted no one else can use it. The idea is the reward new ideas being created in an economy. 

For a patent to pass it must be **Novel** (not already in the public domain), **Non-obvious** (something that anyone in a field couldn't come up with), **have industrial application** must bring some use to society that the patent is registered in.

#### Computer Programs
In the UK and EU patents are not applicable to computer programs. Hence computer programs aren't patentable in the UK. Software can get patented by getting lumped in with other patent for example software along with a car they work for (backdoor patenting).

Its much easier in the US. If you make an idea public then it is no longer novel and so can't be patented. You may release object code to show a idea working but not source code.
