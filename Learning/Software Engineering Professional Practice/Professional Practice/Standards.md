# Standards
We need to comply with stands to comply with law (data protection etc.). There is a whole collection of standards in general that define how software is developed and how functionality is achieved. We will look at a generic standard and an avionics standard etc.

## What are Standards for?
For some things it matters how well our software works and it needs to adhere to specific standards for example software controlling a chemical plant or a car. *Standards* establish criteria or process that should be followed in order that a certain product works in a specific way within a field.

There are international standards and country standard organizations for example (BSI in the UK and DIN in Germany). There are also international standard organizations (ISO, IEC, ITU etc.). Some standards are *generic* and cover many fields.

## What do Standards do?
Maintain that things are done in a certain way. This helps the market since we all have to follow the same rules (no cost cutting). This comes with the process of regulation as an industry develops. They help with *international trade* as the whole world does things in the same way so we can share internationally. It *lowers barriers to market entry* as a market revolve rates around agreed standards that mean that new entrants as all you need to do is meet a standard simply. It can also *diffuse new technologies* as if a standard is agreed anyone who buys it knows they can get it from anyone else who just complies with the standard. It also *protects human safety* as safety is part of the standards hence we can ensure anything we are buying is tested and safe for use. But there is a balancing act as not all risk can be removed but it does cost to go further.

Modern standards define goals rather than a process. This is as before the goals were achieved and so the paperwork was but the final result wasn't what was wanted. Instead all that is held up to the standard in the outcome.

**Standards** can be adhered to by a organization to show that they perform in a certain way. Anyone contracting or wanting something from the organization may care about what standards are. 

## ISO 9001:2015
This is *Quality Maintenance Standard* and is a *generic standard* as it applies to many industries.

For example **ISO 9001:2015** has many sections 

1. scope
2. normative references
3. terms and definitions
4. context of the organization
5. leadership
6. planning
7. support
8. operation
9. performance evaluation
10. improvement

This process is a *cyclic* where we have a *plan* 4-6, *do* 7-8, *check* 9 and *act* 10.

So to *plan* we capture the organization, capture the needs of the stakeholders , scoping the range of QMS and QMS and process. Then we need to get *leadership* involved, to develop policy, give our roles responsibilities and then we plan for the QMS, actions to target risk and opportunities, quality objectives and mechanisms to achieve this and then we make planning changes.

So to *do* we figure out our **support** where we look are what we have *resources*, *competence* who can do what,  *awareness*, *communication*, *documentation*. Then we have **operation** where we perform *operational planning*, get *requirements on quality made up* and make our *design*. At this state we look at how we can control the use of external products and services, we figure our the production of our product and services and we release our products and services.

Then finally we **check** and **act**.

When we have a *standard* we can have *certification* that ensure our process or products comply with a standard.

## DO-178C 
This is an *avionics standard* it ensure that avionics is up to spec. *Avionics standards* make up a complex web made to ensure planes are safe and up to spec. Software must be tested to comply with this and must adhere to it for use in the US.

## IEC 61508
This is a standard to assure functional safety in processing equipment with programable electronic systems as subcomponents.

The two above are *sector specific* standards that apply to a subset of organizations as a whole even if some are more or less specific.
