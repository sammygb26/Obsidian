# Organizations
There are many different kinds of organization (commercial, public , NFP). We will look mostly at commercial. 

## Legal Entities
We will look at 3 main types of organizations.

1. *Sole trader* which is the organization of just an individual. If turn over is big enough you will need to register to VAT etc. The individual is liable for company debts so a Sole Trader individual's assets can be taken away to repay company debts owed.
2. *Partnership* is the form a group must trade under unless it is a *limited company*. Here everyone is liable to company debts that is part of the partnership. This is the form usually taken by professional organizations *law firms*, *medical*, etc. Everyone is fully liable to debts of this entity.
3. *Limited Company* this is the form usually taken by companies it mean the liability of the company is limited. 

## Limited Companies
There are three principles to a legal company. 

1. The company is a legal person separate from the people who own or work in the company.
2. Ownership is divided into shares that can be bought and solve by shareholders.
3. Owners of the company have no obligation to pay debts incurred by the company - it is limited to the shares they own.

In the UK we have plc (public limited company) where the stocks can be held by the public. Then we have Ltd or Private Limited company where the public cannot be held by the public.

## Setting Up a Limited Company
This is fairly simple. A group of people agreeing to give an amount of money to set up an organization to peruse some goal. Then the company is registered under the law. This requires two documents *Memorandum of Association* and the *Articles of Association*.

*Memorandum of Association* -> name, location of registered office, object of the company, liability clause (limits of liability of the owners), share capital (e.g. 100 shares value per share) (to be PLC need over £50k). Concludes with declaration of association that lists the people who are involved in setting up the company.

*Articles of Association* -> More complex, how the company will run and what directors will do how shares can be added. Basically describes the mechanism of the company.

After being registered these documents are stored in a public deposit at Companies House. Share holders can also add more details in a *share holders agreement*. This isn't public but says details of rules for people with shares.

## Directors
If shareholders don't run the company in this case **directors** are appointed. They have *domestic obligations* owed to the company like taking care of the owners and employees' interests, acting in good faith, do well are your job an declare conflicts of interest. There are also *legal/external obligations* like being aware of the financial position of the company, make annual reports and accounts to the Companies House and make sure to comply with any relevant laws. There are *executive* (employed) and *non-executive* (non-employed) advisors. Every company has to have a company secretary responsible for required communications (can also be director).

## Setting up a Company
This isn't necessary to just employ a lawyer or accountant. The easiest way to is buy an "off-the-shelf" companies and then change it for the problem you want to solve. In UK you can register a company for £100 but is still slower since you have to fill out many forms. UK and US have similar systems.

## Non-Commercial Bodies
Most jobs are provided by limited companies the rest are public services like NHS, Police etc. These are set up as *Statutory Bodies*. In the UK Royal Charter sets up free-standing bodies that are independent from the state like for example universities. Not-for-profit organizations are often set up as limited companies.

# Organizational Models
This is how the organizations are actually structured and how they work inside. This is given in *organizational theory*. This develops two models.

1. *Bureaucratic Model* -> Here employees are split into specialists. Each role is precisely specified so one expect can be substituted for another. Every person has to just do their own work. Employees work in a formal impersonal way. Recruitment is based on qualifications and everyone is protected from arbitrary sacking.
2. *Organic Model* -> This is a more natural way for people to organize where people are hired more to get on with the team and its treated more like a group of friends you would induct people into, get pushed out of or leave.

## Matrix Model
We know that the bureaucratic model is too restrictive as people may fill many roles and so report to many managers. The rigid structure is too hard. **Matrix Model** allows for this multimanager system. Here work is shared between people, this is specified within rules giving people scope on their job.

## Models and Principles
These look at how work should be shared and how we structure people together. *Organizational Models* shows how the work is divided and people are organized within the company. *Organizational Principles* describes how models are decided and how different structures within the company are related. *Organizational Structure* is usually given in a **organogram**.

This shows who reports to who and so the structure of the company. The **organogram** can show many different things in its structed like different people as above or different areas such as teams in a company or areas of focus. It show who is in charge of what and whom.

## Structuring Principles
Many different principles can affect how we structure a company. **Function** we can structure based on what parts do. **Geography** if we are working in multiple areas or countries then we may need to split into parts that focus on different markets. This is often required due to laws and so subsidiaries are split up. **Ownership** say if different parts are own my different groups hence the organization must be split in this way. **Product Line** where we may structure our program around the different things we make or provide. **Market Sector** mean we structed our company the different markets our customers belong to. **Technology** we can split up based on which parts specialize in different fields. **Operational Structure** this is the different parts our company needs to function so we can also split in this way.

Our structure can be deep or wide depending on how many levels of organization it has

## Centralization
In a *centralized* company as much power as possible is kept at the top of the organization structure. While the opposite is true in *decentralized* organizations.

# Managers and Leaders
*Managers* are involved in operational functional matters. Then *leaders* and *directors* are involved in more broad planning. The *manager* needs to develop timetables, organize people, delegates, controls, corrects, communicates, motivates, delivers and looks makes sure the employees are doing as desired. *Leaders* emerge and are perceived as competent for the role they coordinate, evaluate, plan, give opinions, motivate. But they also help with social side like reconciling differences, arbitrating, encouraging participation, increasing cohesion allowing all to do the best job they can. So leaders look over a wider area and focuses on the vision for the future. *Managers* are replicable and trainable. But *Leaders* provide direction and can arise from anywhere they aren't easily replaced and cannot easily be trained hence it is important to find them to continue a line of leaders.

# Controlling Organizations
The organization functions as a mechanism to maximize value for shareholders. They are driven by markets so a lack of understanding of a market lead to poor performance no customers and no business. They are also driven by resources s a lack of understanding leads to a lack of control. Hence  senior employees must have deep understanding of the field.

## Performance Areas
This is what affects how well your company is doing. Like for example *standing* how well you are doing compared to competitors, *innovation* are you inventing new things to optimize the market, *productivity* how efficient is your company at delivering a product or service, *physical and financial resources* what you company owns, *profitability* how much you actually control, *worker performance and aptitudes* how well functioning your workforce is, *manager performance and development* how well does the company mechanisms function and *public responsibility* you companies standing with the public.

## Markets and Marketing
In marketing we try to understand the market and make thing people will want or pay for we have to understand people and the fields they work in. Many tools exist to help with this.

## Forces
There are many forces that can act on a company such as **New Entrants** (who are blocked by *barriers to entry*) companies that could rise to be competitors. **Suppliers** organizations you rely on to do your job. **Buyers** the end consumer who supplies you with money. Then **Substitutes** which are other things that might become *competitors* (like CDs to vinal records. All these forces are effected by the market hence the company a company need to be able to deal with the effectively. The *barriers to entry* are the challenges a new competitor must overcome to start taking over the market so more might make current companies more stable.

**Monopolies** happen when a company controls all buyers that is you are the only source of a product or service people want. This this can be bad for people. If *buyers* have complete control then we have a perfect market but this is quite impossible in reality.

#### PEST / SWOT
This allows us to look at a market in a broad way. So we look at the *political*, *economic*, *social* and *technological* areas of the market. Or we look at *Strengths*, *Weaknesses (internal)*, *Opportunities* and *Threads (external)*. This allows us to analyze our companies position relative to others.

*Political* -> Could look at emissions in cars as this has a political element
*Economic* -> Control of rare earth production
*Social* -> Who is planning on using your product, car sharing...
*Technological* -> New products like hydrogen, recycled vehicles (can also interact with political systems)

## 4 Ps of Marketing
*Product*  -> Quality features, name, packaging, services, guarantee
*Price* -> High, low, discount, credit
*Promotion* -> Advertising, personal selling
*Place* -> Distribution, Retailers, locations

All of these will influence how we interact with the market and hence our performance.

## Competition
You can compete in many areas. You can compete on cost or differentiation so you can make something cheaper and just as good or make something different and so better than the competition. Competitiveness based on core competencies for example anyone can make Coca-Cola but it takes a lot to be the market leader that really only one company can have. Anyone can fly a plane but you companies functioning defines how well you individually function. When we have multiple companies in a market they must all be better than another in some way otherwise they wouldn't be in the market. Hence they occupy a Neche. So a company can try to identify a Neche that can allow them to survive.

## Market Repositioning
As a market changes a company may have to pivot in a new direction. For example McDonalds pivoting to have healthier options. RBS pivoted after 2008 to be more of a local bank instead of international bank. Apple originally made computers but instead moved to more personal phones and services like maps and finding devices in their ecosystem.
