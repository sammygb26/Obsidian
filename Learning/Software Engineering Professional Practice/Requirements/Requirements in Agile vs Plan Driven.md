# Requirements in Agile vs Plan Driven Development
Requirements engineering is useful for both main [[Processes]] Agile and Plan driven. There are important differences in how they actually work.

## Plan-Driven
In plan driven we work within each step and iterate until we have done it the right way. So in Plan-Driven we will to RE until we get it right. The documentation feeds design and implementation. There can be iteration depending on the process and requirements change.

So these steps are done well and until finished the iteration mainly happens within RE instead of back to it.

## Agile
Here we do iteration and implement, so we are lighter on documentation. Each step we choose the most important requirement and implement them. The iteration happens cross activities instead of within activities. RE will therefore happen at the same time as design and implementation. This is since the customer is under constant communication to make sure they are getting what they want and what they priorities change between activities.
