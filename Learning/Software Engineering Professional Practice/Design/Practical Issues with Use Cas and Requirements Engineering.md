# Practical Issues with Use Case and Requirements Engineering
(*Personal Take*)
The idea is how to make the most out of requirement and use cases. Will also look at how you progress in your career. Have to bear in mind SE is real life and things don't work the way you thought they would. We want to be at our best -> do our best engineering, use best tools, be most professional. **In reality** when you design software its always about the process in the background, **In reality** you can't just develop software and expect people to use but you need people to have the right skills in place to use it not to mention laws and teamwork. Its not all requirements engineering and use cases.

## Normal Flow
Someone has an idea (*usually high level*). Then a budget is made ad requirements are taken an use cases are made (user stories -> communication). Then there are issues, changes, legal issues, managers change, etc. Things go wrong! The originally written articles from requirements engineering will stay the longest and probably change slowest, hence we should be careful with them as our project leans on this. We can use this to give a reason for problems (also means we should take it seriously).

We would really like a nice direct path to release, but in reality we will go back and forth between all tasks and changes requirements mid development or we find we cannot implement something. Everything can change. You have to keep an eye on **errors** and make sure to learn from errors and learn. Chaos is normal you can't purely control it without giving up actual effectiveness, instead should make it manageable. You want **creative** chaos but not **distracting** chaos. Any new idea will have setbacks during actual implementation that will require us to re-design it.

## Requirements
The people always matter most. Technology can change but users cannot so if you don't appeal to users then your software won't be embraced. Need to take account of everyone in a business (security officer) as you need to satisfy everyone before you can release. Making requirement you are a requirements engineer but this can be often outsourced and you want to query this. You want to look out for the user and make sure they are represented. But of course you have to level with the user and make sure they're being realistic, but also if the client gives something you have to defend their requirements. As a **requirements engineer** you are not looking at how to build the software you just look at the end goal and the perfect program, this is since you are the user advocate.

## Projects
A project will be anything where work is don't and it will be made out of many parts. Often large projects and mixed methodologies, with overall structured project consisting of sub-project, inside this you would use agile development. The project will affect you directly and it matter what the user thing since ultimately they are paying your salary.

**In the project there will be two sides** -> Your side made out of you team-mates and team-managers. You care about scope and importance, security etc. **Then there is your side** -> The client, the end-user, planning team, managers, IT, security, design, higher management etc.

**Who to talk to** -> Usually end users just talk about functional requirement along with ideas for non-functional requirements. But these people are important since they know existing software and structure and care enough to help it work right (telling you dark secrets like problems with the business). Then other stakeholders will have different levels of functional and non-functional requirements.

You will produce a document, you want to find the users story. The planning and organization teams will see the broader vision. It may look at if you are using the correct specs and infrastructure (**pay attention to this**). Security might also take issue and this needs to be fixed. Management wants to make sure you capture the idea. Requirements can be detailed and laid our or they can be rough designs and idea of how they work. You need to pay attention to this as requirements give you a backbone to lean on. They define what you need to do and if something goes wrong you can lean on them as evidence on your side.

## How?
We want to whiteboard, pinboard with cards or mind mapping (or online). Images work well since good for communication and also help get past language. You want "everyone to have access, give everyone a pen" etc. You can use UML tools for structuring idea but not too soon as they can limit flow.  Note requirements can come in many ways. You may want them written down so they are concrete and someone else always has to read them back so not work with buzzwords and jargon (watch out for customer). Since if the customer isn't sure then there is distrust and they aren't sure you get them. You also want to watch out for the people who aren't talking and get everyone's say. Then people don't really work when managers are in the room. You want to watch out for older people since they will be anxious about using the software. You want to **remove anxiety** when getting requirements **make people feel heard** and **make people feel they are getting what they want**. Managers will care about non-functional requirements like cost and time to market. **Mid-level** will care about completeness and can it be extended. **Users** will care about how complicated it will be and them actually using it.

## Symbols Tips
**Careful** -> There could be problems and issues
**Need additional consideration** -> More input from users
**Makes users happy** -> you want them on your side (cool feature), you want them on your side as they support you
**Like it a lot** -> Personally
**General processes are involved** -> Needs changing (probably careful as well)

## Use cases
Once you have requirement you make use cases for them. Can use it to show you understood the users. This is described by actins done by users. Use case diagrams can look well for users who don't get SE (very simple).

Use cases are good as they show the users if you understood then and can make sure yo do understand them. Helps you group you building blocks and see patterns. **Use cases** will help you to simplify a problem and break it down until you have what you actually need.

## Agile
Initial requirement are less important so you go over design again and again. This can be risky if you don't pay attention. Can make it easier to design new features since you already have feet on the ground an understand how you program works. Be careful not to do too little design and analysis and be sure you have high level use cases and can sprint for use cases.
