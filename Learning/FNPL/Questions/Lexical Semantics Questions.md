What are lemmas and sense when talking about lexical semantics? #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions
	A **lemma** is a expansion on the morphological idea of a stem word. It captures the unit of the morphology of a word that differentiates the meaning of a word. For example "constructions", "construction" and "construct" may have the same stem (construct) but have different sets of meanings which apply to each. One lemma for constructions and construction and another for construct. The lemmas have different sets of **senses** which are the true units of meaning. Two senses are the same if the truth conditions they give for a sentence are the same and so they can be substituted without changing the meaning of the sentence.

What are wordforms?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	These are related to **lemmas** which are the unit of language senses are grouped around while **wordforms** are like instances of these lemmas. sing (lemma) -> sung, sang sing (wordforms).

---
When is a lemma polysemous?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	A lemma is polysemous when it has multiple senses which we will have to discriminate between.

What is the principle of contrast when it comes to synonymy?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	The principle of contrast states that every different word always has a different meaning in a sentence. We cannot substitute words and maintain the exact meaning and so there are not complete synonyms.

How can word similarity be evaluated?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	We can ask people on a scale from 1-10 how related two words are. The average for many people will give us a score of how similar two words are.

What is the difference between word similarity and word relatedness?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	Relatedness doesn't quantify how close two words meanings are absolutely but instead asks how common two words meanings are. So a "car" is very different than a "house" by there is a relatedness that doesn't exist say with a "dog" as houses can be used to talk about cars say with horsepower.

---
How is word relatedness measured?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	Word relatedness is measured through association. We ask what word comes next say after "worker" and we might get words that don't mean the same thing but are **related** "nail", "hard hat", "Hi-Viz" etc.

What is a semantic frame?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	A semantic frame is a grouping of words that give perspective on some specific event. For example a transaction or the progress of a journey. Words can be related in complex ways referring to things connected by their relation in the frame.

---
What are connotations?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	Different words can be used which may literally mean the same thing but their use gives a different effect and places the speech in a different light. For example "murdered" vs "eliminated" in terms of the killing of someone. These give different senses of the nature of the killer either crazed or efficient and calculating.

---
What are the three major axis word connotations vary upon?  #flashcard #FNLP #LexicalSemanticsQuestions 
	The the major axis are **valence** (how positive some sense is), **arousal** (the intensity of emotion of a sense), **dominance** (the degree of control exerted by a sense).
