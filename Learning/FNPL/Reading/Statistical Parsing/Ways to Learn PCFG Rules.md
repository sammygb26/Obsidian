One way is to use a treebank. We can find the probabilities for out PCFG by looking at the number of time each expansion occurs and then normalizing. $$P(\alpha\to\beta\mid\alpha)=\frac{\text{Count}(\alpha\to\beta)}{\sum_\gamma\text{Count}(\alpha\to\gamma)}=\frac{\text{Count}(\alpha\to\beta)}{\text{Count}(\alpha)}$$If we don't have a treebank we can use a non-probabilistic parser on unambiguous sentences. Since most sentences are **ambiguous** we will have to use a probabilistic one though. But we are calculating this with the probabilistic one. In the end we can use the **inside-out** algorithm which is a special case of [[Expectation Maximization]].
