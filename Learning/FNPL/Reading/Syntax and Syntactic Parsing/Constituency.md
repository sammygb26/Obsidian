This concerns how words fit together in English. For example we can take a **noun phrase**, a sequence of words surrounding at least one **noun** some example are

These are basically **things**. We know these words group together (or **form constituents**) by the fact they all appear in similar syntactic environments. For example before a verb

The whole phrase can combed before the **verb** but the individual parts cannot!

Hence we don't refer to the words and instead to the phrases saying *"noun phrases can occur before verbs"* for example. Another bit of evidence for constituency comes from **preposed** and **postposed** constructions. For example the prepositional phrase "on September seventeenth" can be placed in a number of different locations.

But its individual parts cannot!
