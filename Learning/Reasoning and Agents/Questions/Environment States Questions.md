What is an **atomic representation**? #flashcard #RA
	In this representation of environment states each state is indivisible and is only described as a state in and of itself (think vertices in a graph)

---
What is a **factored representation**
? #flashcard #RA
	A factored representation is partly described by variables and attributes so different states can have elements in common.

---
What is a **structured representation**
? #flashcard #RA
	A structured representation has the state represented not just with attributes but also objects defined with relations between them.
