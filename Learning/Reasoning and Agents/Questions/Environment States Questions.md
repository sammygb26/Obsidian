What is an **atomic representation**? #question
	In this representation of environment states each state is indivisible and is only described as a state in and of itself (think vertices in a graph)

---
What is a **factored representation**? #question 
	A factored representation is partly described by variables and attributes so different states can have elements in common.

---
What is a **structured representation**? #question 
	A structured representation has the state represented not just with attributes but also objects defined with relations between them.
