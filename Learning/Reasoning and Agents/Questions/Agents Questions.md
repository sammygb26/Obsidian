What is an agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	An agent is anything that can be viewed as perceiving its environment through sensors and acting upon that environment through actuators .

What does percept and percept sequence refer to when we are talking about agents? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	We use the term percept to refer to the agent’s perceptual inputs at any given instant. An agent’s percept sequence is the complete history of everything the agent has ever perceived. In general, an agent’s choice of action at any given instant can depend on the entire percept sequence observed to date, but not on anything it hasn’t perceived.

What parts describe an agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	An agent is describes by it's **sensors** which allow it to have sensations (from the **environment**), it's **goals which** it combines with the percepts from the sensors to choose actions which use **actuators** to influence to **environment** to accomplish the agents goals.

What is a reflex agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	A reflex agent is an agent whose action only depends on its current sensations or perceptions. It doesn't take into account any previous perceptions.

---
What is a model-based agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	A model based agent has an internal **model**. This is a understanding the agent has of the state of the world how its actions will affect it and how the environment will evolve on its own. The agent then uses this view of the world to choose its next action.

What is a goal-based agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	A goal based agent is an agent whose goal can chance. The agent must be able to adapt to different goals and solve them like individual problems. For example a self-driving car may be given different destinations and getting the car to these destinations are the different goals the agent must complete.

---
What is a utility based agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	Agents of this type have to juggle goals. The **utility** is a measure of how well an agent is acting and it can be a combination of many goals.  So a utility-based agent isn't accomplishing a goal it is trying to maximize many goals.

What is a learning agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	A learning agent instead of having a fixed way of tackling its environment will change over time given its previous experience. So instead of just doing the same thing every time it encounters the same situation it will learn and change its behavior. 

---
What is a rational agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	 For each possible percept sequence, a rational agent should select an action that is expected to maximize its performance measure, given the evidence provided by the percept sequence and whatever built-in knowledge the agent has.*

---

What is an autonomous agent? #flashcard #RA #Agents
	An autonomous agent is an agent that doesn't require inbuild knowledge it is able to find out on its own what actions are best and how to function best.
