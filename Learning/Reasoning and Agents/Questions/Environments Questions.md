What parts describe a task environment? #question 
	A task environment is defined by **PEAS** or Performance, Environment, Actuators, Sensors.

---
What are the types of observability of an environment? #question 
	An environment can be **partially** or **fully** observable. In an environment which is partially observable only part of the state of the environment can be perceived that is we can't know the complete state of the environment. In an environment that is **fully** observable the entire environment's state is know by the agent at all times.

---
What are the types of determinism of an environment? #question 
	An environment is **deterministic** if our actions have know outcomes and **stochastic** if the outcomes are not known.

---
What are the ways an environment can't or can be sequential or not? #question 
	An environment is **episodic** if the previous states don't affect the current one like a simple image processing agent processing unrelated images. An environment is **sequential** if the following states depend on the actions we take in the current state. 

---
What are the ways an environment can be static or not? #question 
	An environment can be **static** when it is unchanging and we can always make the same actions and they have the same effect (think a rubix cube). An environment is **dynamic** if the actions we can take and the perceptions we can make and the outcomes of our actions change with time (think an autonomous car).

---
What are the ways an environment can be discrete or not? #question 
	An environment is **discrete** if percepts, actions and episodes all happen in discrete interval like moves in chess for example. An environment is **continuous** if action happen continuously and flow with time.

---
What types of environment are there when it comes to the number of agents? #question 
	There is **single** agent environment where there is only the our agent. There there are **multiple** agent environments where our agent has to predict and work against (**competitive**) or work with (**cooperative**).

---
What are benign and chaotic environments? #question 
	In general **benign** where the environment if fully observable deterministic, episodic, static, discrete and single agent. But a **chaotic** environment is partially observable, stochastic, sequential, dynamic, continuous and multi agent.
