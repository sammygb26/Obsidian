This paper goes over recent supervised and unsupervised training methods for **Spiking Neural Networks** (SNNs). The motivation is even though Deep Learning with Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) has been very successful it doesn't shed light on how the brain works in many ways. This is due to the difference in architecture. The brain (and SNNs) relay on discrete events in time while ANNs have continuous value outputs and inputs.
