What is a greedy algorithm? #flashcard #IADS #Algorithm
	A greedy algorithm is an algorithm that always make the choices that are the best in the short term or look the best. This approach works when these choices help in later stages in the solution but it doesn't work when more wholistic solutions are needed and we start blocking of the true solution with these choices.
