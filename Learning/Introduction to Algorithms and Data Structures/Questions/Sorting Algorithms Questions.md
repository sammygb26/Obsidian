How does insert sort work? #question 
	This works by for each element in the array we compare it to every element to its left if it is smaller that the one to the left we swap them then move to the next value to the left. We do this until we have reached the end or we have a value that is smaller than our value. This builds up a sub list that is sorted one element at a time.

What is the asymptotic running time of insert sort? #question 
	In the worst case it is O(n^2) and in the best case it is O(n) however in the average case it is also O(n^2)

---
How does merge sort work? #question 
	Merge sort works by breaking down a list into sub lists of similar size these sub lists are sorted then we merge the two back together. The key idea is it is computationally more efficient to merge already sorted lists than unsorted lists.

What is the asymptotic running time of merge sort? #question 
	In the best, worst and average case it will be O(n lg(n))
