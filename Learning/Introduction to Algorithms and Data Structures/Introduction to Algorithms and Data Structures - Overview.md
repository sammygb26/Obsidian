This course Introduction to [[Algorithm]] and [[Data Structures]] will cover many areas. Looking at Algorithms we will look at [[Algorithm Efficiency]] and Data Structures through the lens of [[Asymptotic Analysis]]. We will also look at [[Graph Traversal]] and the efficiency of the Algorithms used in it. We will look at different [[Sorting]] Algorithms and their strengths and weaknesses and so what makes a good Sorting Algorithm. We will also briefly look at [[Probabilistic FSMs]]. We will also look at [[Context-free Languages and Grammars]]

The [[Sorting]] Algorithms looked are:
	[[Bubble Sort]]
	[[Insert Sort]]
	[[Merge Sort]]
	[[Quick Sort]]

The other [[Algorithms]] studies are:
	[[Dijkstra's Algorithm]]

The tequniques for studying [[Algorithm]]s are:
	[[Asymptotic Analysis]]

The [[Data Structures]] looked at are:
	[[Array]]s
	[[Heap]]s
	[[Linked List]]s
	[[Tree]]s

The graph traversal tequniques looked at are:
	[[Breadth-First Search]]
	[[Depth-First Search]]

[[Dynamic Programming]] will also be covered some of the problems solved will be:
	[[Coin Change]]
	[[Edit Distance]]
	[[Fibonacci Numbers]]
	[[Seam Carving]]
	[[All-pairs shortest paths]]
	[[Viterbi Algorithm]]

We will also look at grammars with 
* [[Context-free Languages and Grammars]]
* [[LL(1) Predictive Parsing]]
* [[Parsing Context Free Languages]]
