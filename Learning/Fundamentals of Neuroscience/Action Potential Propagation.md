# Action Potential Propagation
We have looked at the causes of the action potential once triggered in a neuron ([[The Action Potential]]). There are many other signals that could be used for example we move chemical signals around our bodies in our blood. Single cells even signal using diffusion. The reason electricity is used in us is it is far faster. 

## The need
We need to send signals quite far. In some cases up to a meter. This can be done in wire as it is very conductive but cytoplasm is around 10,000,000 times less conductive. Not only this but we also have voltage leakage across the membrane and capacitance to worry about. We could increase the voltage but this would actually overwhelm the insulative properties of the membrane. Instead the electricity isn't the true signal the depolarization is what moves along the axon.

## Signal as State
This can be thought of as a wave moving through water. The water overall isn't moving but the wave itself moves. In the same way inside the neuron the equivalent of a wave an action potential triggers depolarization in the area around it and an action potential is fired creating more depolarization and so on.

This state behind it will have and absolute and relative refractory period because of this a depolarization will not trigger a new action potential behind the signal. Because of this two signal can collide and cancel out and signals only travel on one direction.

The shape of the voltage as it moves down the axon will the the reverse of the action potential as the pasts at the end of the wave has had their action potentials the longest time ago and hence are at the end phase. The reverse is true of the later stages.

## Speeding it Up
We now understand how the signal itself propagates but how can we speed this up? For the state to move a region need to become depolarized. This is described by our [[Passive Membrane Properties]] namely the length and time constant ($\lambda$ $\tau$). For a patch to be depolarized the voltage must reach it and this is described by the length constant (how large the bubble of depolarization is and how far is reaches). How quickly it is actually depolarized si described by the time constant. We want to increase the time constant and decrease the length constant. We can *decrease the axial resistance* to increase the length constant. Then we can also *decrease capacitance* to decrease the time constant allowing the signals to travel faster.

Both these approaches are used in our brains and nervous system to make some signals travel faster.

## Giant Axons
This is one way the signals are sped up. Some axons for example in squid can read up to 1mm in thickness many orders of magnitude larger than the width in humans. This will decrease the axial resistance. These giant axons were used to examine for the first time the resting potential and action potential by Alan Hodgkin and Andrew Huxley.

## Myelinated Axons
Giant axons can be hard to make and very large for longer distances instead in humans we use *Myelin*. This is created by glia cell which are support cells in our brain. The fatty Myelin is wrapped by the glia around the axon many times (although the axons are still far smaller then giant axons). Myelin is filled with *fatty lipids* and therefore acts like an *insulator*. The myelin isn't continuously places around the axon as this would prevent the ion channels from functioning. Instead it is placed in sections with gaps in-between. These caps are called a "*node of Ranvier*", these have a high density of sodium and potassium channels. The signal will "come up for air" in between the Myelin to get a boost form ion flow then the signal can reach the next node of Ranvier. This is called *Saltatory conduction*.

The effect of myelin is it reduces the membrane resistances (by increased membrane (dielectric) thickness) and increases membrane resistance (by reducing permeability as ion channels are blocked by the myelin.)
