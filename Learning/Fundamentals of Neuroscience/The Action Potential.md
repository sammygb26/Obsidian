# The Action Potential
The communication between neuron takes place using changes in membrane potentials. These fast change are called **action potentials**. They are sent down the axon to notify other neurons. But the properties we have covered so far will not help with actually sending signals they are all passive. We know that only letting a small amount of Sodium in the body will change the potential massively but we cannot just do this with the previous leakage channels. Instead **voltage gated channels** are used. As the voltage around them change the charges parts of their structure shift in order to change their conformation to either be open or closed. That is the conductance changes.

## Phases of Action Potential
The two *voltage gated* ion channels that are mostly involved in signaling and creating therefore large changes in voltage are the Sodium and Potassium channels. The timing of their opening and closing creates a flow that gives the shape of the action potential.

The first gates channel we can consider the the voltage gates sodium channel. This is activated when the voltage gets slightly higher only form ~70mV to ~40mV. So they are mostly closed at ~70mV and mostly open at ~40mV. Many things can also shift this range and allow for sensing and other communication between neurons.

When the voltage increases a small amount sodium is allowed to rush in by the voltage gated sodium channels. This quickly makes the voltage across the membrane depolarize and become positive. This is a positive feed-back loop that amplifies any small positive voltage change.

The voltage gated sodium pump then has another deactivation mechanism when the voltage gets too high which moves it into a inactivated state. This nullifies if the usual channel is open and close causing the sodium channel to completely close.

The potassium channel is then used to lower the voltage quickly again to allow for more signaling. The voltage will in fact undershoot becoming hyperpolarized. The potassium channels will then close and there will be a slow recovery back to the usual voltage.

This all gives 6 phases in the sequence. First we have a **resting phase** where the neuron is ready to receive a signal. Then we have **stimulation** where there is a small rise in signal. Then we have the **rising phase** created by a positive feedback loop with the sodium voltage gated channels. They are then inactivated and potassium channels are activated causing the **falling phase**. This then **undershoots** hyperpolarizing the membrane before the potassium channels close and the resting potential is returned to.

## Channels and Probability
The channels are not completely open or close there are may of them in the membrane and they are open and close randomly. The voltage affects which one of their conformations is more likely due to it being lower energy. But all channels can be open and closed at any time. The channels aren't voltage gated per say they are voltage influence in such a way that the voltage gates the average state. This is why the curves are smooth and not stepped.

## Channel Kinetics
Kinetics describes how the probability of a chemical system being in different states changes over time. Something with *fast kinetics* can change state quickly and something with *slow kinetics* can change state slowly. This is what causes the sodium and potassium channels to open and close at different times despite both being stimulated by a positive voltage. The sodium deactivation also has *slow kinetics* leading to the inactivation takin place later.

This also lead to a *refractory period* where we cannot educe another action potential.  These two period are called the *absolute* and *relative*. In the absolute no action potential can be triggered as the sodium channels are inactivated but in th relative period an action potential can be triggered but just with more effort and the voltage is negative so it will take more extra voltage to make it positive enough to trigger a new action potential. That is the relative is cause by open potassium channels.
