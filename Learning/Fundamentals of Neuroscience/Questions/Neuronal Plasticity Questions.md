What is neuronal plasticity? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity
	**Neuronal Plasticity** is the brain's and nervous system's ability to change how they act in response to changes in the *environment*, *behavior* or *injury*. It is what creates our ability to remember, learn and change.

---
What are the two overall categories neuronal plasticity breaks down into? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	These are **short** and **long** term plasticity. *Short-term* lasts from milliseconds to minutes while *long-term* lasts from minutes to hours and even lifetimes.

---
What are the two forms of short term neuroplasticity and what commonly leads to them? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	These are **synaptic enhancement** or **facilitation** which is the short term strengthening of the connection between two neuron and also **synaptic depression** or **fatigue** which is the short term weakening of a neuron. *Enhancement* is commonly caused by an increased change of releasing neurotransmitters while *depression* is caused by a depletion of neurotransmitter containing vesicles ready to be released.

---
What is another way to think about short term plasticity other than enhancement and depression and why does this make sense form a sensory neuroscience point of view? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity
	We can instead think about **adaption** in which the brain adapts to any regular signal therefore it instead detects changes rather than any steady state. This makes sense as our brains from a survival point of view are more interested in possible changes rather than things we already know.

---
What mechanisms lead to adaption in our nervous system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	Short term *enhancement* and *depression* lead to adaption but also other mechanisms at the network level of say sensory organs or larger brain structures play a role.

---
What is LTP and LTD? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	This is Long Term Potentiation (LTP) and Long Term Depression (LTD). In these changes take place to the strength of synapses taking place on timescales more than a minute. In LTP the synapses get stronger while in LTD the synapses get weaker.

---
In what context was LTP first discovered? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	It was first discovered in while studying anesthetized rabbits. When a neurons in the hippocampus were *strongly stimulated* firing of some downstream neuron took less work (LTP). Meanwhile when modernly stimulated there was not change and when infrequently stimulated there was reduced activation to the downstream neuron (LTD). These effects lasted on timescales over a minute.

---
What is Hebb's rule? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	It is an **organizing principle** describing when synapses are strengthened or weakened; that when neurons commonly lead to another neuron firing the synapses and so connection between the neuron is strengthened or **potentiated** while if not correlated the connection is weakened or **depressed**. This is summarized as "neurons that fire together wire together and neurons that fire our of sync loose their link".

---
What terms are used to describe when a connection (synapse) is strengthened or weakened? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	We use the term **potentiated** to mean strengthened and **depressed** to mean weakened.

---
Why is Hebb's rule attractive? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	This is as it neatly explains classic associative learning like with Pavlov's dogs aswell as many other phenomena seen in humans and animals it even has some clear examples like NMDA receptor dependent potentiation however it isn't the only organizing principle at play in our minds and non-Hebbian and anti-Hebbian mechanisms also take place.

---
What are some other names for Hebb's rule and what it represents? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	This can also be called *Hebbian Theory*, *Hebb's Postulate* and **Cell Assembly Theory**.

---
What is true about all LTP occurring between neurons? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	All LTP leads to stable changes in the molecular structural features of the synapse. These changes can happen at the *axonal bouton* or *dendritic spine* or through changes to the *post synapse proteins density*.

---
what are the three ways have a synapse be potentiated? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	This can come from changes causing **more neurotransmitter** to be released, and increase in the **number of receptors** or **larger effect** from each receptor already present. All of these and combinations of them are at play when LTP occurs and their reverses in LTD.

---
What is the main structure of the NMDA receptor and what are it's special features when compare to the AMPA receptor? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	Both the NMDA and AMPA receptors are glutamate (key excitatory neurotransmitter). While AMPARs are classic ligand gated ion channels importantly letting both Potassium and Sodium ions pass, NMDARs not only require glutamate binding but also glycine making them harder to open. The pore accepts a magnesium ion blocking it when the membrane is polarized meaning both depolarization and ligand binding are require for the NMDA receptor to open. NMDARs also allow Calcium ion to pass along with Potassium and Sodium ions which is important for NMDARs effects.

---
How does NMDA Receptor Dependent LTP occur? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	NMDARs allow Calcium ions to enter the neuron. These ions activate the enzyme CAMK2 (Calcium Calmodulin-Dependent Proteins Kinase II) which activates two downstream biochemical and metabolic mechanisms. **1)** It triggers a biochemical cascade leading to phosphorylation of AMPA receptors  allowing them to open more easily and **2)** It triggers a biochemical cascade leading to the production and transport of more AMPA receptors to the synapse. Both these changes lead to potentiation of the synapse.

---
What are the four main interesting properties of NMDA Receptor-Dependent LTP? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	These are **1) Input Specificity** once induced the LTP on one synapse hardly spreads to other nearby ones even in the same cell. **2) Associativity** when one single stimulation isn't enough but along with another input is enough to cause an action potential firing both synapses responsible will be potentiated. This is likely due to both depolarizing each other along with action potential back propagation depolarizing while both synapses still have enough neurotransmitter present to bind NMDARs. **3) Cooperativity** weak stimulation of may synapses and action of AMPA receptors can depolarize the cell enough leading to NMDA receptor activation and wide spread potentiation. **4) Persistence** the potentiation caused can last from minutes to hours, months and longer.

---
Why is it important to have LTD aswell as LTP? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	LTD counteracts the constant potentiation caused by LTP without LTD synapses would tend to be stronger and stronger over time would could damage them aswell as causing a loss in dynamic range for the synapses.

---
What is Hebbian LTP and LTD? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	Hebbian LTP is the classic statement that "neurons firing together will wire together" and a strong causal link from one to another will become strengthened over time. On the other hand Hebbian LTD is describes as "neurons our of since loose their link" this occurs when a synapse firing doesn't coincide with a action potential firing.

---
How is Heterosynaptic LTD different from Hebbian LTD? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	Hebbian LTD is summed up as "neurons our of sync loose their link" however an example of Heterosynaptic LTD could be neuromodulators causing a cell to weaken certain synapses.

---
How is LTD different from common LTP when we look at different areas of the brain? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	The mechanism leading to LTD change depending on the **brain region** for example different mechanisms in areas like the sensory cortex, prefrontal cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum and also **developmental stages**.

---
What is the key difference between LTD in the cerebellum vs the hippocampus and how is LTD similar in both areas? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	In the cerebellum LTD is caused by **strong synaptic stimulation** while in the hippocampus is is caused by **persistent weak stimulation**. In both areas LTD is accomplished through decrease in post synaptic receptor density. This is through to be done by marking the AMPA receptors to be recycled and remove phosphates from them. 

---
What is Spike timing dependent plasticity? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	In cells the precise timing when an action potential arrive vs when one is sent our from the cell is important to whether potentiation or depression is observed. When a pre synaptic action potential arrives just before a post synaptic ones fires the potentiation will be strongest however the other way around and major depression will be observed.

---
Why is Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity though to exist? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	Spike Time Dependent Plasticity leads to the identification and potentiation of causal relationships where a pre synaptic spike arrives just in time to trigger a post synaptic firing. We don't just want to highlight general firing together but causal firing.

---
What is non synaptic plasticity and what is another name for these mechanisms? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity
	Non-synaptic plasticity also called **homeostatic mechanisms** are caused by changes to a neuron on the level of dendrites, axon or soma. They are caused by changing ion channel functioning to cause overall more firing of the neuron of less.

---
Why is non-synaptic or homeostatic mechanisms through to exist? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #NeuronalPlasticity 
	These mechanisms lead to neuron not becoming overly active which could lead to them damaging themselves or the network they are part of. Furthermore it leads to inactive neurons reactivating and so being able to contribute to a network where before they may fall out of use. Hence these mechanisms lead to healthy and efficient brain activity.
