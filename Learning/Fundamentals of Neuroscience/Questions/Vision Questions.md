What rough percentage of the brain focuses on vision and what is the main roles of vision? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	About half of the brain is involved in vision. Vision detects, processes and interprets information from visible light allowing our brains to generate a 3D map of the world around us.

---
What is the overall path used to give us vision? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	Vision starts in the retina where photoreceptors generate action potentials corresponding to light levels. From here the optic nerve takes the information to the thalamus. Nerves then projects it on further to the visual cortex at the back of the brain. This is where shape, color, object identity, distance and motion are parsed out.

---
What is the major anatomy of the eye? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The eye has a cornea which does most of the light focusing, then an iris creating the equivalent of an aperture for the eye. The eye lens is controlled by ciliary muscles allowing for its shape to change hence allowing us to focus to different levels. The light then hits the retina which is a specialized layer of neurons and photoreceptors which finally send axons our in the optic nerve.

---
What is the region where more photoreceptors are concentrated called? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This is called the *fovea* and is located in the center of our vision. This limited vision is made up for my the eye moving on average three times a second. The pattern of photoreceptor distribution changes for different animals however.

---
What does the eye use to move itself? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The eye uses the **oculomotor muscles**.

---
Roughly how many photoreceptors are there in the eye? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	There are about 100 million photoreceptors in the eye.

---
How many layers does the vertebrate layer have, how many main functional stages and what are their names?  #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The vertebrate retina has 10 layers and 3 functional stages. The stages are photoreception, internal transmission and output (note the photoreception stage with photoreceptors is at the back of the eye).

---
What cells make up each of the functional stages in the retina? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	The **photoreception** stages is made out of photoreceptors. These are split into two types cones and rods. Cones are sensitive to different colors giving us color vision while rods are more sensitive to light levels. In the **internal transmission** stage there are bipolar cells, interneurons. For the **output** stage there are retinal ganglion cells whose axons project out in the optic nerve. Throughout all layers there are also horizontal and amacrine cells providing lateral connection, synchronization and integration.

---
What is phototransduction? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This is the process by which photoreceptors detect light and signal using it. It is an electromagnetic to chemical to electrical cascade.

---
What are the parts of a photoreceptors and their role? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The **outer segment** detects light and contains the light sensing complexes. The **inner segment** amplifies this before it is sent down to the **synaptic terminal** where communication with other cells takes place.

---
What is the ratio of rods to cones? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This is about 20:1, we need far more rods than cones as the cones are meant for light conditions where there is less noise in the senses.

---
What is the protein complex responsible for phototransduction called and how does it work? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	This is called rhodopsin and is a complex made out of a GPCR protein complex called opsin and a ligand called retinal (vitamin A). The GPCR is tightly bound to retinal but retinal absorbs a wide variety of light and when it does it changes shape (11-cis retinal to all-trans retinal). When activated the G proteins transducin is activated shutting down chemical pathways with second messenger proteins leading to less glutamate being released by the synapses of the photoreceptor.

---
Where is rhodopsin present in the photoreceptor? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	It is present in the outer segment disks.

---
How is color vision obtained by the visual system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This is done by using three different cones as in cone photoreceptors. There is a S-cone or short wave cone (blue), M-cone or medium wave cone (green) and L-cone or long wave cone (red). Every color activates these condes at different relative levels hence objects with different spectrum can have the same apparent color. This three sensor way makes humans trichromats.

---
If two spectrum make the same color what does that make them relative to each other? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	They are metamers.

---
What are the two types of vision we experiance in different light levels? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	We have **scotopic vision** in night when our cones can't detect much. As cones are unreactive but rods are we therefore see in black and white. Then in the day we have **photopic vision** here the rods are bleached and the cones are active allowing full perception of color although less brightness detection and fidelity.

---
What cells in the retina give of action potentials? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The only cell to do this in the retina are retinal ganglion cells (the ones responsible for output). Instead only membrane potential is used to communicate before the retinal ganglion cells.

---
What is the receptive field of a retinal ganglion cell? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The receptive field is the area in visual space a given retinal ganglion cell is active when light in that region is present.

---
What does the center surround organization for retinal ganglion cells mean and what are the two types? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	There are two areas the center and the surround. When the center excited and the surround inhibits this is called an on-center cell and off-center for the revers. Both these make up the center surround organization.

---
What are the organization patters of the retinal ganglion cells? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This describes the patterns of light in the visual field that gives rise to activity in these neurons. The common pattern is center surround thought there are other which react to color and motion in a limited way though most of this information is parsed in the visual cortex. These patters are thought to come from amacrine and bipolar cells.

---
Inside the retinal circuit what the the two pathways called to a retinal ganglion cell and how do they work? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	The two types are the lateral and direct pathways. The **direct pathway** from the photoreceptor goes to a bipolar cell then to a retinal ganglion cell. This is the shortest hence called the direct path. In the **lateral pathway** horizontal and amacrine cells are involved modulating activity. These pull information from further afield that the bipolar cells.

---
What does it mean for a bipolar cell to be on or off with respect to the direct pathway in the retina? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	An on cell responds to a lack of glutamate and an off cell responds to a presence of glutamate. Therefore on cells activate when their center receptive field is on and not when it isn't (as photoreceptors invert light levels with neurotransmitter output). **On** cells use GPCRs to hyperpolarize in response to glutamate while **off** cells use glutamate gated ion channels to depolarize.

---
How do bipolar and horizontal cells combine to give the center surround activation pattern? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	Bipolar cells respond to photoreceptor activity in a small region and are inhibited by horizontal cells pulling form a wider ring around this cluster. This gives them opposing center and surrounds. This is called **antagonistic surround** and leads to the same effect in the RGCs the bipolar cells are signaling to.

---
What do dorsal, ventral, anterior and posterior mean with respect to the brain? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	**Dorsal** means top, **Ventral** means bottom, **anterior** means front and **posterior** means back.

---
What is the Retinofugal projection? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	This is the projection from the optic nerve which takes visual information out of the eye.

---
Where do parts of the Retinofugal projection go to when responsible to involuntary eye movement towards a stimulus? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This projection goes towards the tectum and is responsible for orienting us in our environment aswell as this involuntary attraction.

---
Where do parts of the Retinofugal projection go when responsible for optokinetic reflexes? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	These projections go the the **accessory optic system** and are responsible for vibration reduction and stabilizing the eye using the oculomotor muscles.

---
Where does the major projection in the Retinofugal projection go that end up in the visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	This goes to the thalamus and specifically the **lateral geniculate nucleus**.

---
What is the path of the Retinofugal projection from the eye to the visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The axons leave the eye moving along the **optic nerve** at the **optic chiasma** the axons on the left and right of the visual fields are separated out (from just each eye). As the image if flipped this means information from our left goes to the right and so on. The *optic chiasma* leads the axons to form the **optic tract** which bring the combined left and right visual fields to the **lateral geniculate nucleus** where the axons terminate. From here they move forming the **optic radiations** all the way to the **visual cortex** where the axons terminate.

---
What are contralateral and Ipsilateral axons? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	Contra lateral axons cross the midline at the optic chiasma while the ipsilateral axons do not.

---
What is the structure of the LGN? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The lateral geniculate nucleus has 3 layers for the ipsilateral and contralateral axons so 6 layers in total. The most ventral layers contain larger **magnocellular** m-type neurons while the four dorsal layers contain smaller **parvocellular** p-type neurons. There are also **koniocellular** neurons which appear to be involved in color information. 

---
Where does 80% of the LGNs innervating axons come from? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	80% of the LGN's innervating axons come from the visual cortex. Before projections are made out of it to the visual cortex. It is thought these loops like this called **thalamocortical loops** lead to some of the rhythmic brain activity seen on an EEG.

---
What are the differences in the receptive fields of the magnocellular and parvocellular receptive fields? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The magnocellular cells have large receptive fields while the parvocellular neurons have small receptive fields.

---
What is the cerebrum? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The cerebrum is a structure of folded layers on the outside of the brain. It is fundamentally a 2D structure that is folded giving its appearance. It is about 2mm thick in humans on average each and is made up of layers corresponding to different cell types. This **laminar structure** has 6 layers in most places.

---
Where is the primary visual cortex located on the cerebrum? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	It is located in the *calcite sulcus* or *striate cortex* so names as layer four appears as a dark layer here (called the *stria of Gennari*). It is caused by LGN axons innervating the V1 cortex here.

---
In what way does the visual field enter the visual cortex as a patter and what is this called? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	They enter preserving their position in the visual scene for example central at the back and peripheral further forward. This is called *retinotopy*.

---
Where do the different LGN neuron's axon's terminate in the primary visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The m-types and p-type cells terminate in layer four preserving which eye the comes from on ocular dominance columns. That is in these columns neurons are mostly activated by the eye the columns corresponds to. If an eye is covered then its corresponding columns will atrophy. This was important for early study of neuroplasticity.

---
What features to neurons in the V1 cortex respond to? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	In the V1 cortex neurons react to the same receptive fields as ones in the eye aswell as small line segment and moving line segments.

---
What are the two main visual pathways from the primary visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	The two main pathways are the **ventral pathway** which processes "what" things are and so is called the "what" pathway. The other is the **dorsal pathway** which processes "where" things are, motions and how we interact with them.

---
What is the path for information in the  ventral pathway (visual cortex)? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	In this pathway information starts in **V1** where small scale features are extracted. It moves to **V2** which is just in front of *V1* from here it moves to an area on the *ventral surface* called **V4**. It then goes to n area called the **inferior temporal cortex** which sits at the bottom of the brain.

---
In the ventral pathway how does the type of information change along the path (visual cortex)? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The information starts as abstract point and small lines segments. Larger line segments and contours can be found in **V2** then in **V4** we can get responsivity to curvature and corners. By **IT** we can sense whole objects and recognize faces.

---
What kind of information is processed in the dorsal pathway in the visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This pathway processes information about space and motion. The middle temporal area **MT** seems to encode movement of and object. While the posterior parietal area seems to involve visual space and focusing on certain areas.

---
How are the functions of many brain areas understood? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	This is done through lesion studies. A part if the brain's functionality is removed and then the effects are noted.

---
What are the kinds of lesion studies? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	There are experimental lesion studies in animals which are either *permanent* where a pieces of the brain is destroyed with chemicals or removed or *temporary* where optogenetics or drugs are used to remove functionality from a pieces of brain. Human brains cannot be studies this way however so instead observed lesions are studies like those form disease, stroke or injury.

---
What do lesions in **V1** and **V2** cause? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	These cause *scotomas* which are small blind spots created in the visual field.

---
What do lesions to **V4** and **IT** cause? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	These cause *agnosias* where certain objects cannot be recognized. For example *prosopagnosia* where faces cannot be seen.

---
What deficiencies can come from lesions in the dorsal pathway in the visual cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision
	Lesions in the  middle temporal area can lead to *akinetopsia* or motion blindness where the world looks like a series of still frames and movement cannot be understood. Lesions in the posterior parietal area can lead to areas of the scene not being understood or ignored and lesions damaging both sides can lead to *Balint's syndrome* where individual objects can be seen but they don't fit together at all.

---
What is the binding problem? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Vision 
	The binding problem is the question of how we go from a split apart scene where neurons fire for something being red or in a certain place or moving in a certain direction to the experience of seeing something red moving. One solution is synchronous firing for each object but the true answer isn't known for sure yet.
