What is **resting potential** in neurons? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	Resting potential is the membrane potential (voltage across the membrane) neurons exhibit when they are at rest. It is usually about -70mV

What are the forces the lead to this potential across the membrane? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential 
	There are two **diffusion** (which isn't really a force more like the manifestation of randomness) and the **electrostatic** force which is the force of attraction and repulsion between charges.

What allows diffusion and movement of ions through the cell membrane and how do they achieve selectivity? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	It is facilitated by ion channels which are specialized proteins that create a gap for certain changers to pass through. **Selectivity** is achieved through  selectivity filters created by simulated solvation shells that mimic solvation shells around specific ions hence it is unfavorable for the ions that don't match to go through.

How does a concentration gradient and electrostatic force cancel out to give a equilibrium potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	The concentration gradient creates a diffusive effect meaning more ions move from where they are most concentrated to less concentrated just randomly. Since they are charged this means on either side of the membrane a change is imbalanced (opposite on the more concentrated side and sam on the other side). This creates a voltage which pushes the charges back in. Equilibrium potential is reached by an ion when the concentration gradients diffusion matches the electrostatic force.

What is the **Nernst Equation** and what are its parts? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential 
	It is $E_{\textrm{ion}}=\frac{RT}{zF}ln\frac{\textrm{[ion]}_\textrm{extracellular}}{\textrm{[ion]}_\textrm{intracellular}}$ , $E_{ion}$ is the Nernst potential (equilibrium potential) $R$ is the gas constant, $F$ Faraday's constant, $z$ ion valence, $T$ temperature and $[ion]_e$ and $[ion]_i$ are the concentrations of the ion inside and outside of the cell.

What is driving force? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	This is the apparent force that moves ion concentrations. It is the difference between the membrane potential and a particular ion's equilibrium potential. So it measures how much an ion would like to move across the membrane.$\textrm{Driving Force}=V_{\textrm{membrane}}-E_{\textrm{ion}}$

What is the GHK equation? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	This is a measure of the resting potential of a neuron taking into account a few ions that contribute to resting potential, as well as the permeability or ease at which they can move through the cell membrane.$V_m=\frac{RT}{F}ln\frac{P_k[k]_o+P_{Na}[Na]_o+P_{Cl}[Cl]_i}{P_k[k]_i+P_{Na}[Na]_i+P_{Cl}[Cl]_o}$

---
What is **hyperpolarization** and **depolarization**? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	**Hyperpolarization** is when the membrane potential gets more negative. **Depolarization** is when the membrane potential becomes more positive.

What is the role of the Sodium Potassium Pump? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #RestingPotential
	Potassium and sodium have the same charge and exist in somewhat opposite concentrations inside and outside the cell. The cell membrane is somewhat permeable to both. So if they can just swap places then no charge imbalance occurs and so there is no equilibrium. Hence equilibrium voltage will no be maintained. To solve this the Sodium Potassium pump swaps 2 potassium for 3 sodium consuming ATP to maintain the concentration gradient.

---
What controls membrane resistance? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	Membrane resistance is controlled by the permeability of the different ions across the membrane. This is despite the membrane itself being a reasonable insulator. The permeability is controlled by how easily the channels allow ions to pass and how abundant they are.
