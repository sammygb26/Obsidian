What are the two kinds of post synaptic potentials (PSPs)? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition
	The two different kinds of post synaptic potentials are *excitatory* and *inhibitory* post synaptic potentials. Excitatory ones increase the change of a action potential while inhibitory reduce the probability.

What are the five possible outcomes of a neurotransmitter? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are to **bind to a receptor** (which happens in a microsecond). Then we can *escape* however this is unlikely as it takes around 1000 times longer to exit the synaptic cleft. We can also be **absorbed** after binding into the post synaptic terminal (sometimes with the complex). We can be **broken down** (eg. acetylcholine by acetylcholinesterase). Glia can take us up either outside or in the cleft with *transporter proteins*. Or any *combination*.

---
What are the three sets of differences that class synapses? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are *fast and slow*, *strong and weak* and *excitatory and inhibitory*. **Fast and Slow** refer to how quickly the synapses act and this can very from a millisecond to many thousands of times slower. **Strong and Weak** describes the effect the synapse has on the soma's potential and so if an action potential will be released or not. Then **excitatory and inhibitory** describes if the synapse increases or decreases the chance of an action potential respectively.

---
What effect do excitatory and inhibitory neurons have on post synaptic membrane potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	**Excitatory** synapses will increase the post synaptic membrane potential for a time. **Inhibitory** synapses will leave the membrane potential largely unchanged but will have a shunting effect and reduce and *excitatory signals* around them.

---
What is the only thing that truely affects if an action potential is fired or not? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	This would be the membrane potential at the axon hillock where the axon leaves the soma.

---
Where are excitatory and inhibitory neurons generally located on the cell? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Excitatory synapses are generally placed at the dendrite spines while inhibitory ones are generally on the dendritic arbor, soma and axon hillock.

---
What is the reversal potential of an ion channel? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	The reversal potential of an ion channel is the voltage over the channel at which the inflow and outflow will be roughly equal. This is the point the ion channel will pull the voltage towards when opened. It is difference for different channels but equal to the equilibrium potential of a single ion if that ion is the only one which can pass. If not is is a weighted combination of all the ions that can pass.

---
What leads to the effects of excitatory and inhibitory synapses on the post synaptic potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	This effect is driven by the opening of ion channels. These channels may let a combination or only a single ion through. Either way they will pull towards their reversal potential. So inhibitory synapses have receptors will low reversal potential pulling the membrane voltage to resting while excitatory synapses have higher ones pulling towards an action potential. Inhibitory channels are usually anion-selective as potassium is an anion.

---
What are somatic synapses? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are synapses which target the cell body or soma of the post synaptic neuron.

---
What are cations and anions? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Cations are positively charged ions or molecules while anions are the same but negatively charged.

---
What is the main excitatory neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	The main excitatory neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system is acetylcholine.

---
What is a ligand-gated ion channel? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	A ligand gated ion channel is an ion channel that opens when a ligand (some molecule) binds to it. This changes the conformity of the channel such that ions can flow through.

---
What are the nicotinic receptors? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are receptors that bind acetylcholine and are example of ligand-gated ion channels. They produce a fast strong excitatory potential. They are named as nicotine also binds to them (as well as other exogenous chemicals).

---
How many vesicles are release when a motor neuron fires at the NMJ? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Around 50-90 vesicles containing acetylcholine are released stimulating nicotinic receptors.

---
What makes up the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, what is its structure? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	It is made up of 5 protein subunits. Two $\alpha$ subunits and one each of $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$. This makes up a cone structure that spans the membrane. The pore itself is around .8nm in diameter. The $\alpha$ subunits bind for acetylcholine and initiate the conformation change that opens the channel only when both sites are bound. There are 4 membrane spanning domains for each subunit M1-4 with all the M2 domains facing into the pore having a negative charged amino acids and so allowing positive charges through.

---
Why does the nicotinic receptor depolarize despite allowing both potassium and sodium into the cell? #flashcfdxewdA|ZAZard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	The reason for this is that even though the permeability for both ions is increased sodium has a higher driving force so has more of an effect on the potential. All this is also described by the reversal potential being not positive but also not as negative as potassium, it is around -10mV.

---
What is channel desensitization? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	This is a way channels avoid overexcitation. If a channel is repeatedly stimulated over any over again by ligand binding. It will stop responding to the binding with a given chance.

---
What do we mean by an inward and outward current when talking about ion flows over the membrane? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	An inward current is when positive ions move in or negative ones move out. Then an outward current is when positive ions move out and negative ones move in.

---
What are two common excitation disease states, what causes them and how can they be treated? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition
	Myasthenic gravis (is an autoimmune disorder) while Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome CMS is an inherited neuromuscular disorder. The first is classed as an **autoimmune channelopathy** where antibodies target and deactivate or destroy natural ion channel proteins.  This can be treated with immunosuppressants and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. CMS is caused by defects in the genes coding for the ion channel receptor proteins. This can also be treated with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

---
What is the most prominent excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	This would be glutamate (glutamic acid is also used). This is a building block of protein so comes with the speculation these proteins originally evolved for sensing food.

---
How can we achieve specificity in neural transmission when only one main excitatory neurotransmitter is used? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition
	This is done by having many post synaptic receptors. From the Ionotropic receptors (AMPA receptors  and NMDA receptors). Then also metabotropic receptors G-Proteins Coupled Receptors (GPCRs).

---
What are GPCRs, what percentage of protein coding genome make them up  and how much modern medical drugs target them? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	They are G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Around 4-5% of proteins coding genome codes for them. They are also the target of around 40% of modern medical drugs. They are slow acting and get also set of chemical pathways through the cell.

---
What are the two ionotropic glutamate receptor families? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are AMPA receptors and NMDA receptors so named as AMPA and NMDA bind to each respectively. Both are promisors ion channels and allow cations to pass through. They are both ligand gated bit NMDARs also have a voltage dependent component such that when a the membrane is depolarized they can become dislodged. So NMDAs are only activated when both a high voltage and glutamate signal is received.

---
What are the two neurotransmitters used for inhibitory synapses and where in the body are they most common? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are GABA and glycine. Which act on GABA and glycine receptors respectively. GABA is most prominent in the central nervous system while glycine is most prominent in the spinal cord.

---
What are the GABA and glycine receptors similar to, what structure and properties do they have? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	They are most similar to the nicotinic receptors that have acetylcholine as a ligand. Hence they are ligand-gated ion channels. They however have neural or positive M2 domains in their subunits hence are anion-selective. They reversal potential is therefore defined largely by chlorine making it around -65mV. 

---
How does chlorines reversal potential lead to shunting in the inhibitory GABA and glycine receptors? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	These are ligand-gated ion channels which when opened let chlorine pass. Chlorine has a resting potential f -65mV making the reversal potential of the channel around -65mV. This is very close to the resting potential of -65mV hence very little change will be seen in many cases. But as soon as some other channels open depolarizing the membrane the inhibitor channels will allow chlorine to pass keeping the voltage low. This effect is called shunting.

---
What are agonists and antagonists? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Agonists are chemicals that activate a receptor while antagonists prevent a receptor from being activated.

---
What are some example of GABA and Glycine antagonists and agonists? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Some antagonists include Picrotoxin (GABA) and Strychnine for (Glycine). The receptor is inhibitory so these antagonists allow for excitation to go unposed leading to muscle convulsions, stiffness and eventually death if the diaphragm cannot move. Alcohol, Barbiturates and Benzodiazepines are all GABA agonists. They give relaxing sedative effects by enhancing the effects of GABA.

---
What is positive allosteric modulation and how do barbiturates work? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition
	Positive allosteric modulation is how barbiturates affect the GABA receptor in the brain. This means they bind outside the normal binding site and have a positive modulatory effect on the functioning of the GABA receptor. Hence they inhibit select pathways in the CMS.

---
What is hyperekplexia, what causes it and how can it be treated? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ExcitationAndInhibition 
	Hyperekplexia is a neurological disorder where genes encoding for glycine receptors caused them to be impaired. This can causes an exaggerated startle response sometimes even leading to uncontrolled falls. It can be treated by clonazepam which acts to increase the effect of GABA and so cause inhibition to replace Glycine.
