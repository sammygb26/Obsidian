# Excitation and Inhibition
When we look at downstream neuron potentials after excitation or *Post Synaptic Potentials* (PSPs) we can split the synapses into two types *excitatory* and *inhibitory* synapses. This is caused by different neurotransmitters being released which then can affect a wide range of proteins and molecules on the post synaptic side affecting the likelihood of a action potential being triggered.

### Life of a Neurotransmitter
Synaptic transmission across the cleft only takes around a microsecond as the neurotransmitters (and neuromodulators) cross. Once released a *neurotransmitters* takes one of 5 fates.
1. It **binds to a receptor** on the other side of the neuron. Given the speed of an average transmitter across the cleft (in between a snail and cyclist, 0.05 MPH) and the width of the cleft. It take only a single microsecond for this to happen.

Now the *synapse* is actually quite wide and takes a millisecond to **escape**. This is a significant difference as the neuron needs to be able to register when a signal is observed in time exactly. If neurotransmitters stayed they could bind again and again to the receptors. So there are mechanisms found that make sure this doesn't happen.

2. They can be **absorbed** by the downstream neuron (and sometimes the whole receptor bound complex aswell).
3. Receptors can be **broken down** by enzymes in the synaptic cleft. For example *acetylcholine* is cleaved by *acetylcholinesterase* in the synaptic cleft.
4. **Transporter** proteins can take up the transmitters that exist on glia cells around and sometimes in the synaptic cleft.
5. There can also be a combination of all of the above. Like the parts of a broken NT being absorbed by the post synaptic cell.

### EPSPs and IPSPs
Synapses are classified based on three sets of differences. We have *fast and slow* synapses the first taking millisecond and the second acting hundreds or thousands of times slower. We have *strong and weak* synapses many weak signals are needed to trigger an action potential while only few strong ones are needed. Then there are *excitatory and inhibitory* synapses which either increase or decrease the chance of a action potential firing.

*Excitation* and *inhibition* are largely defined by their affect on the membrane potential of the downstream neuron. We may have the following case with many synapses into a neuron (yellow). We will consider a *blue* neuron (excitatory) and **red** neuron (inhibitory).

![[Pasted image 20220527095111.png]]

With the *blue* excitatory neuron the post synaptic potential will move to be more positive for a time after stimulation of the upstream neuron. Hence the downstream potential is closer to threshold hence why this neuron is excitatory. The potential in the downstream neuron is an Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential (EPSP). This serves as a go signal for the post synaptic potential. The only thing that truly triggers an action potential is the potential at the **axon hillock** where the axon meats the soma. The effect at the hillock for an EPSP is different than the effect at the synapse and depends on many factors like the shape of the dendritic arbor, distance between the synapse and cell body, number of other inhibitory and excitatory synapses and the timing of the input however there are more. Generally a *single* action potential doesn't trigger an EPSP large enough to trigger the downstream neuron. So *many* are needed either from the single cell firing many times or form many cells. The integration and examination of inputs to decide whether to fire is a source of a large amount of complexity in the brain.

There is also the Inhibitory Post Synaptic Potential or IPSP which reduces the likelihood of the post synaptic neuron firing. The **red** inhibitory neuron connects to the post synaptic cell. The membrane potential seen in the post synaptic potential after stimulating this **red** neuron is small. But tends to prevent post synaptic neuron form firing an action potential. It is therefore seen as a stop signal. The IPSP may not change the membrane potential a lot but it changes the *electrical properties* of the membrane to work against EPSPs.

Different ions have different Nernst potentials. For example Potassium -90mV, Sodium 55mV and Chlorine -65mV. When the membrane is made more *permeable* to an ion the membrane potential moves towards that ions Nernst potential in general. Making the membrane more permeable to Sodium therefore depolarizes the membrane. If we make the ion concentration of potassium greater we can change the membrane potential to be more negative. The IPSP can then be observed. For example with a small dip. This may be caused by opening Chloride channels so pulling the potential closer to -65mV. So the IPSP can even increase the ion membrane potential to just be closer to some ion's Nernst potential. This acts like an anchor making it harder for the EPSP to affect the membrane potential. They don't just have to *open chloride channels* but have also been found to *open potassium channels*, *block calcium channels*. Different placements of synapses can also affect which signals are inhibited or which areas of the cell are excited etc. **Somatic** mean cell body targeted. 

![[Pasted image 20220527101611.png]]

The fast excitatory post synaptic potentials are mediated primarily by cation-selective ion channels. A *cation* is an ion or molecule that is positively charged while an *anion* is negatively charged. So potassium channels would be *anion* channels. So *anion*-selective ion channels mediate IPSPs.

### EPSPs in Depth
*Acetylcholine* is a neurotransmitter released at the neuromuscular junction. It is the first neurotransmitter ever discovered. Once released it interacts with nicotinic receptors at the surface of the motor neuron plate to produce a classic fast strong excitatory potential. Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors are also excited by other exogenous chemicals for example by nicotine hence their name. So both acetylcholine and nicotine act as stimulants at these synapses. When the motor neuron fires at the NMJ it releases around 50-90 acetylcholine containing vesicles. *Acetylcholine* acts with high specificity to bind its receptors which are perfectly aligned with the nerve terminal. But how is the EPSP created. We need to look at the *acetylcholine receptor*. It is a ligand-gated ion channel which means that it opens when a specific chemical the **ligand** binds to it. As in many channels it is made our of a combination of separate proteins called *subunits*.

![[Pasted image 20220527103953.png]]

It is made out of two copies of the $\alpha$ subunit aswell as one copy each of the $\beta$, $\gamma$ and $\delta$ subunits. These proteins are aligned in the cell membrane to create a pore about -8nm wide. Just enough to let small ions and their water entourage or solvation shell pass through.

![[Pasted image 20220527104214.png]]

Looked at from above the receptor has the shape of a donut. From the side it has a large extracellular domain aswell as a small intracellular domain.

![[Pasted image 20220527104338.png]]

Each fully assembled receptor has two binding sites for acetylcholine neurotransmitter on the alpha subunits on the large extracellular domain. The whole complex it made out of 5 subunits. Each subunit in turn has four membrane spanning domains termed M1-4. The subunits are arranged such that all the M2 subunits are in the central pore. When *both* ligand binding site (for acetylcholine) are bound the receptor pore will open allowing ions to flow through.

When a single receptor is activated not much happens as only around 1-2pA of current flows. But a typical synaptic current at the NMJ is around 600,000pA therefore around 300,000 receptors for acetylcholine must be bound. All the receptors open at roughly the *same time*. However they close randomly. Once enough ligand-gated AchR are bound sodium channels can take over.

![[Pasted image 20220527105238.png]]

During the falling phase acetylcholine receptors close randomly. Potassium channels help reset the membrane potential to be ready for another signal.

### Acetylcholine Receptors in Depth
You may ask which ions flow through the acetylcholine receptor. It is a *promiscuous cation channel* meaning Sodium, Potassium and small amounts of Calcium can flow through. These are all cations which is ensured by the M2 domain lining the inside of the channel having many negatively charged amino acids.

![[Pasted image 20220527110213.png]]

We can note that Potassium (Hyperpolarizes) and Sodium (Depolarizes) will have difference effects on the membrane potential when allowed to flow in. The *driving force* for Sodium causes it to move in while the *driving force* for potassium causes it to move out. There is a **reversal potential** when the current in equals the current out when the *driving force* educed currents cancel out. For this receptor that is around -10mV (average of the sum of the Nernst Potentials of Sodium and Potassium). This means any channel allowing multiple ions to flow through will have a reversal potential which determines its ability to affect the membrane potential.

We have already looked at how neurotransmitters are removed from the cleft to get away from unwanted excitation or inhibition. But there is another way ion channels avoid this problem. When channels open for too long due to repeated action of neurotransmitters binding and unbinding, individual channels will become closed. This is called **desensitization**. This is similar to inactivation of sodium channels as if the channel was blocked. This is used to relax muscles for example Succinylcholine is similar to acetylcholine and binds to the receptor but it cannot be removed by acetylcholinesterase and stays in the cleft for a long time leading to desensitization and so paralysis. Many toxins act by blocking this receptor and can cause muscle weakness, paralysis and eventually death via asphyxiation when the diaphragm stops moving.

### Inward vs Outward Currents
We say there is an *inward current* when either: 
1. Positive ions move into the neuron
2. Negative ions move out
(depolarization) these currents by convention are negative (currents track movement of negative charges)

We say there is an *outward current* when either:
1. Positive ions move out of the neuron
2. Negative ions move into the neuron
(hyperpolarization) these current by convention are positive (current are negative in the direction of positive charge flow and positive charge is flowing out of the cell)

### Equilibrium vs Reversal Potentials
The **equilibrium** or Nernst potential of an ion is the membrane potential where there is no net flow of the ion. The **reversal potential** of an ionic channel is the membrane potential at which the net current through at the channel is 0. Each ion has its own *equilibrium potential* and this doesn't depend on what channels are present in the membrane. These are related however when an channel allows only one ion the two are the same. When a channel allow multiple ions the reversal potential will be a weighted average of the original two.

### Excitation Disease States
Exogenous compounds aren't the only way to modulate excitation and inhibition. Diseases like Myasthenia Gravis and Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome can also affect the excitation and inhibition balance. 

*Myasthenia gravis* is an autoimmune disorder which lead to muscle weakness and fatigue the weak muscles are cause by *antibodies* which bind and *destroy* acetylcholine receptors ant the PNMJ. Hence acetylcholine cannot bind and excite the muscle. This disease is classed as an **autoimmune channelopathy** as it features antibodies directly against ion channel proteins which are natural. This can be counteracted by using acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and immunosuppressants.

*Congenital Myasthenic Syndrome* or CMS is an inherited neuromuscular disorder caused by defects of the proteins making up the neuromuscular junction. We cannot use immunosuppressants but can use acetylcholinesterase inhibitors.

### Glutamate and Glutamate Receptors
We have looked ay *acetylcholine* which is the most prominent excitatory neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system. But in the central nervous system instead predominantly uses **glutamate** (glutamic acid is also used). This is an amino acid which is a building block of proteins but also acts as a neurotransmitter when released by **glutamatergic neurons**. A high degree of temporal and spatial specificity is crucial to the proper function of the nervous system but how can we achieve specificity of neural transmission if there is only one major neurotransmitter responsible for fast EPSPs? This is achieved by having a wide variety of post synaptic glutamate receptors.

![[Pasted image 20220527114605.png]]

These are split into two grouped *ionotropic receptors* which directly let ions in. Then *metabotropic receptors* which change the metabolic and biochemical pathways acting indirectly through G protein coupled receptors or **GPCRs**. These aren't ion channels and only let ions pass through a core. Instead they belong to a wide family of receptors that sense molecules outside the cell and activate specific signal transduction pathways and so cellular responses inside the cell. **GPCRs** in face make up 4-5% of the protein coding genome and are the target of around 40% of all modern medicinal drugs.

### AMPA and NMDA Receptors
Glutamate is the main excitatory neurotransmitter of the central nervous system. Out of the receptors it can affect will focus on the ionotropic glutamate receptors. These are in two groups AMPA and NMDA receptors. **AMPA receptors** are found in many parts of the brain and play a key role in many brain functions. Like *nicotinic acetylcholine receptors* in the periphery AMPA receptors are paroicous ion channels permeable to all cations. Also in a similar way they are *ligand gated*. **NMDA receptors** are also important to cognitive functions but have been most extensively studied for their role in synaptic plasticity and learning. NMDA receptors aren't just *ligand gated* but also *voltage gated*. Again it is nonselective to cations like Calcium and Sodium and has an equilibrium potential near 0mV.

**NMDARs** are often called coincidence detectors. They are blocked usually by a magnesium ion. This ion interacts in a *voltage-dependent* way when the membrane is depolarized magnesium exits the NMDA receptor. Hence NMDARs require a voltage change to open. The *initial depolarization* is usually caused by opening of AMPA receptors which are found in the same synapses. Therefore NMDA receptors act as "coincidence detectors" getting activated when glutamate is released in to the cleft (presynaptic event) but also when AMPA receptors start getting activated (a postsynaptic event).

### IPSPs In Depth
Activation of inhibitory synapses decreases the likelihood of postsynaptic action potentials. The majority of **IPSPs** in the central nervous system are due to the action of ligand gated ion channels. These include GABA and glycine receptors. **GABA receptors** which are named after Gamma Amino Butyric Acid (GABA) which is their ligand are the primary IPSP receptors in the *brain*. Now **glycine receptors** are the primary IPSP-generating receptors in the spinal cord. These two receptors are similar to the *nicotinic acetylcholine receptor*. The difference in the M2 domain in the subunits is *positive or neutral* instead of *negative*. This is important as these are both **anion selective** channels. This causes an increase in chloride conductance keeping the membrane potential close to the equilibrium potential of chlorine which is -65mV. Nothing really changes in the potential but this causes **Shunting**. In this despite many neurotransmitters trying to depolarize the neuron the neuron will remain close to resting potential due to IPSPs.

Receptor blockers are called *antagonists* while activators *agonists* have been identified for GABA and glycine. So for example **strychnine** which is a *glycine* antagonist from rat poison causes convulsion of the muscles due to a lack of inhibition eventually leading to death by asphyxiation. Then **Picrotoxin** also known as Cocculin is a plant toxin that acts as a antagonist for *GABA* receptor. Hence as GABAR is inhibitory receptor it has stimulant and convulsant effect causing muscle rigidity and seizures. This toxin has also been used to counteract drug overdoses and barbiturate poisoning.

![[Pasted image 20220527122604.png]]

**Barbiturates** are drugs that act as CNS depressants acting as activators of *GABA* receptors in the brain. They are believed to work through *positive allosteric modulation* meaning they bind outside the normal ligand binding site and has a positive modulatory effect on the receptor function when the normal ligand is present. Hence they effect GABA receptors to inhibit select pathways in the CNS. Nowadays these have been replaced by more powerful **benzodiazepines** this includes (Valium and Xanax). These are harder to overdose on and so more safe. They also work to enhance the effect of GABA at the central GABA receptor. This results in a sedative sleep-inducing, anti-anxiety, anti-convulsant and muscle relaxant effect. **Alcohol** also works to modulate inotropic GABA receptors to induce a calming relaxing effect within limits. But the mechanism isn't fully understood.

### Inhibition Disease States
Diseases can also influence inhibitory synaptic responses in the nervous system. One example is **hyperekplexia** which is a neurological disorder classically characterized by an exaggerated startle response and generalized stiffness. This is caused by a variety of genes encoding for glycine receptor related proteins. Small single amino acid changes in the glycine receptor impaired is ability to open upon activation. Hence reducing chloride influx post synaptic. The best treatment for this is *clonazepam* which acts to increase the effects of GABA and its inhibitory effects.
