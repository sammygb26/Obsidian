What is least squares method? #flashcard #MOB #LeastSquares
	The least squares method is a way of estimating a value behind some mode. That is we take some readings $y$ and a model that would produce this $y$ then we predict the $x$ that formed the $y$.

What is the squared error criterion? #flashcard #MOB #LeastSquares 
	This is the criterion for the solution to least squares is is $$\hat x_{LS}=\arg\max_x\mathcal L(x)=\arg\max_x\left(\sum_{i=1}^Ne_i^2\right)$$

With a linear model what is the form of the model with m measurement and n variables in least squares? #flashcard #MOB #LeastSquares 
	This would be $$\textbf y=\textbf{Hx}+\textbf v$$ Where $\mathbf H$ is the Jacobian matrix of partial derivative of $\mathbf y$ with respect to $\mathbf x$.
