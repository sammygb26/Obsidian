We know that data is everywhere and it is making up a larger and larger part of society. When we talk about doing AI right we need to think about ethics as part of that otherwise what are we really doing.

1. **Public trust** in data-driven innovation is faltering. Machine learning and AI in general and in the power structures people are using.
2. It not just about trusting **tech**, but instead the people who control these technologies.
3. Tech isn't neutral and neither is **data**. A spear is only technology with people otherwise its a point stick. All tech is created and define by people and we design and modify this to our goals. All data is collected for purposes but what is collected is defined by the people who collect it.
4. Innovating with **data** well requires new ethical skill sand knowledge not just good intentions. You have the have the skill to understand what harm can be done and will be done.
5. Ethics is becoming part of a social license to operate for technologists. We need ethics to be able to create this technology in the right way. In order for society to allow us to operate.

### Ethics
What is ethics? 

1. An adaptive social technology evolved to facilitate human community? (evolutionary perspective)
2. A set of universally binding rational principles and morally permissible actions? (deontological perspective)
3. A social calculus for maximizing the sum total of happiness in the world? (utilitarian perspective)
4. A lifelong process of self-cultivation leading to excellence of character and shared human flourishing? (virtue ethics)
5. A way to maintain the ideal of reciprocal care in human relationships (care ethics perspective)
6. A way to align society with a dive order? (faith perspective)
7. How we give what we owe to one another? (justice perspective)

There are many ways to talk about ethics. It is said that it isn't useful because of this plurality. But **we need ethics to maintain stable society**. It is plural because of the ways to flourish together. Ethics is like a boat under construction at sea. Ethics is never perfect we always need it as its better to have ethics rather than not have it.

### Data AI ethics
There are many ethics in AI and data science (privacy, safety, representation, labor, accessibility, fairness, relationships, sustainable, transparency, ethical). AI and data are not just code. They are forms of social power and they are how we control our society and so their problems affect everyone and are central.

Data and AI can improve society in many ways?
1. Automatic captioning making the world accessibly
2. Disaster forecasting reducing harm 
3. Data drive diagnostics improving treatment

Data and AI undermining society
1. Surveillance risks
2. Algorithmic amplification of unjust bias
3. Opaque poorly validated automated decisions
4. Widening economic inequality and precarity of labor
5. Disinformation and manipulation at scale

(with these harms feeding back on those already hard done by)

"the analysis of ethical social issues is a core technical requirement"

### Habits of AI professions
1. Humility
2. Perspective taking
3. Reflexivity - self reflective and moral self-cultivation
4. Respective
5. Responsibility - taking up responsibility on your own
6. Moral imagination

This lead to **practical wisdom** - reliable moral judgement in new unusual challenging or complex where usual rules aren't adequate.
