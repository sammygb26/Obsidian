# Understanding Neuromodulation
**Neuromodulation** is a process by which the synaptic transmission or signaling from one neuron to another is either enhanced or diminished by another third neuron. *Neuromodulators* are chemicals released to affect either the pre or post synaptic neuron. They are released by *Neuromodulatory Neurons* these neurons make their own synapses with the pre and post synaptic neurons. Neuromodulators can act in many ways however most neuromodulators act through GPCRs (G-Proteins Coupled Receptors). They may also act through voltage gated ion channels. *Neurotransmitters* can regulate the excitability and activity of neurons they affects the synaptic strength and communication between them. Neuromodulation is is similar to regular signal transmission at the synapse (seen in [[The Synapse]] and [[Excitation and Inhibition]]) but the process are distinct.

### Processes of Neuromodulation
Neuromodulation is the commonality between mental diseases like Schizophrenia and recreational drugs. As such they both act by changing the strength of synapses throughout the brain. Changes in *synaptic strength* are either due to **structural** or **non-structural** changes in the brain. *Structural changes* in synaptic strength include alteration of number by los or addition or size by growth or shrinkage of synapses occur normally throughout life but are most important in development. But this also happens normally, in old age and in neurodegenerative disorders.

Most changes are **non-structural** however the *efficacy* (strength of s synaptic connection) is changed without structural changes. The change is instead caused by **neuromodulation**. This process is similar to classic chemical transmission on a chemical synapse. But instead of just 2 neurons there are 3 or more involved.

Nothing changes structural from the unidirectional transmission from one neuron to the next. But instead the *efficacy* is increased or decreased so the size of the post synaptic potential is all that is changed. The change is in strength can have it origin presynaptically (with more or less neurotransmitters released) or postsynaptically by altering the response of the post synaptic cell to the neurotransmitters. This isn't black and white and both work together.

### Ionotropic and Metabotropic Receptors
There is a wide variety of post synaptic receptors, both ionotropic and metabotropic. Ionotropic receptors are usually **ligand-gated ion channels** as discussed in [[Excitation and Inhibition]]. These change the post synaptic potential in milliseconds. 

*Metabotropic* receptors change the electric and biochemical properties of th neurons in a range of hundreds of milliseconds to seconds. They don't let ions in directly but act *indirectly* activating intracellular signaling cascades in the postsynaptic cell, they do this by activating *second messenger molecules*. These cascades are made up of molecular interactions, one molecule causes a change in another which interacts with another and so on. This is in general how the inner workings of a cell function. So metabotropic receptors interface with these systems.

The same *neurotransmitter* can act on many different receptors even within a single cell and so can have a wide variety of effects. This allows for changes to take place over many timescales adding to the complexity of signaling. This all together plays into how the nervous system changes over time.

### GPCRs
This is one of the classes and the main class of **metabotropic receptors**. GPCRs have over 2000 different genes coding for them (10% of human genome). They bind many signals however and not just neurotransmitters. However they all have a similar structure outside of their binding sites. These are **transmembrane protein complex** as it binds outside and affects inside. The ligand binding portion is therefore in the extracellular domain of the receptor. The GPCR gets its name from what happens inside the cell. The intracellular domain binds three proteins called *alpha*, *beta* and *gamma*, together called the G-proteins. As they bind the proteins Guanosine Triphosphate or GTP.

GTP is a building block in DNA and RNA, similar to ATP (also used for DNA). Just like ATP it is used throughout the cell for a variety of functions aswell as used to store energy. GTP is also used for intracellular signaling aswell.

How does this complex work however. This is common to all GPCRs.

1. A **ligand** is bound to the outside of the cell affecting the G proteins inside the cell.
2. The **alpha** unit can break free of the **beta** and **gamma** subunits.
3. The freed G-proteins can then bind to enzymes to further affect signaling molecules or chemicals inside the cell.

The signaling modulates are called **second messengers** as they carry a message but removed from the original receptor interaction. An important second messenger in the neuron is *cyclic AMP*. This is generated from adenosine triphosphate (ATP, most prominent energy source in the human body). ATP is converted to its cyclic form by an enzyme called **adenylyl cyclase** which is activated by a *G-protein*. Cyclic AMP can then activated another enzyme called *protein kinase A* or *PKA* which can then activated many other proteins including ion channels allowing flux change across the membrane. Hence giving excitation or inhibition. The complexity in the cascades allows the cell to execute its own molecular logic build up over evolution. The benifit of GPCRs is that a small amount of molecules binding outside can have a **amplified** affect inside the cell.

GPCRs can have **multiple often opposing effects on a single target**. For example in the autonomic nervous system the neurotransmitters norepinephrine or noradrenaline and acetylcholine exert opposing effects on the same organs. *Norepinephrine* gives the *fight or flight response* when *acetylcholine* gives the *rest* and *digest* response. Another advantage is second messengers can **affect multiple targets at once**. For example cAMP can activated and inactivate ion-channels, metabolites in the cytoplasm and even gene expression in the nucleus. *Gene-expression* changes can have a major impact on the cell and last over very ling tine scales. Long-term affects like this are key to *learning*.

### The Serotonin System
This a a major Neuromodulatory neurons for humans.  Serotonin is released in a particular part of the brain called the **dorsal raphe nucleus**. Its receptors are found in many places including the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, amygdala and in the spinal cord. It plays an important role in modulating mood, appetite and sleep. *Serotonin dysregulation* seems to play in important role in many CNS disorder, most commonly major depression. As it affects most it is the target of many antidepressants. One class is **MAOIs** or monoamine oxidase inhibitors which work by inhibiting enzymes that break down serotonin enhancing its effects. Unfortunately this same enzyme works in many pathways breaking down other substances. Hence MAOI users are warned against eating too much cheese as harmful substances in cheese can accumulate since MAO isn't functioning normally. A more modern class of antidepressants are **tricyclic antidepressants**. These work by targeting the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse. If serotonin is allowed to stick in the synapse for longer it will have a greater effect by binding more times with the same receptor. *Tricyclics* also inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine which is also involved in depression. The problem as with many drugs is the off-target effects which include acting and calcium and sodium channel blockers which can have a variety of unwanted effects in the body. A popular class of anti-depressants are the *serotonin selective reuptake inhibitors* or **SSRIs**. Fluoxetine (Prozac (T)) and sertraline (Zoloft (T)) are common SSRIs. These work by blocking serotonin reuptake in the cleft in a more targeted way. However while the biochemical changes take affect very quickly the affects on depression wont take affect for four to six weeks showing the long-lasting effects  Neuromodulatory systems can have. Most serotonin is also found in the gut and blood (clotting). Hence these SSRIs also affects the serotonin in the gut Prozac can also be prescribed for irritable bowel syndrome for this reason.

### Neuropeptides
We have talked about *small molecules* so far which makes sense as they diffuse quickly. But this isn't all neuromodulators. Another class are the **neuropeptides**. These are proteins usually 5-20 amino acids in length which is small for proteins by many times larger than classic neuromodulators. They are often derived from larger precursor proteins that are transported to the terminal and cut into pieces. These act *exclusively through GPCRs*. But are also released along with classical neurotransmitters at synapses. Over 100 peptide varieties have been identified and the list is growing every year. Some examples are *hypocretin* (used to regulate sleep), *Leptin* (involved in appetite) and *Substance-P* known to modulate pain sensation but there are many more. A particular class of them are opioids. The activation of opioid receptors modulate pain perception. 

It was known that opium acted as an analgesic reducing the perception of pain. Later components of it could be isolated notably *morphine* (ten percent) and *codeine* (few percent). These alone had an analgesic effect. In the late 19th centaury a synthetic form *Heroin* was made. We know these substances have a similar structure and effect on us but no ideas as to how. In the 60s and 70s evidence for opioid receptors were found. This first one was the mu opioid receptor. Four kinds of opioid receptors were found called delta, mu, kappa and nociception. These receptors didn't evolve to bine morphine instead there are **endogenous opioids** that the body produces naturally which trigger these receptors. Some examples of these are *enkephalins*, *endorphin* and *dynorphin*. Which each target a different receptor class. The **exogenous** opioids are all small molecules however the **endogenous** ones are all *neuropeptides*.  All the opioid receptors are GPCRs. 

### The Dopamine System
**Dopamine** is another neuromodulator. It is produce by a small number of cells in the brain only around 100,000. The major parts of the dopamine system are called pathways which project to different areas of the brain giving the systems effects. These include the *mesocortical pathway*, the *mesolimbic pathway*, the *nigrostriatal pathway* and the *tuberoinfundibular pathway*. Each pathway targets different brain areas and plays a distinct role. For example dopamine neurons from the **substantia nigra** are involved in movement and in Parkinson's disease are lost for reasons unknown. Since these neurons are dying off a treatment is t supplement dopamine, L-dopa is a chemical precursor to dopamine which is converted to dopamine. 

Dopamine also plays an important role in reward motivated behavior and reinforcement learning. *Dopaminergic neurons* in an area called th **ventral tegmental** area project to many areas of the brain and along with the **nucleus accumbens** form an important reward subsystem in the brain. These circuit are the target of many recreational drugs. *Cocaine* block the reuptake of dopamine from the synaptic cleft thus increasing the time spent in the cleft and so also the chance of binding. Hence Cocaine amplifies the effect of the dopaminergic system. *Addiction* to these drugs isn't fully understood but is largely driven by neurons adapting to the higher levels of dopamine present at the synapses. A mechanism leading to this is the *downregulation* of receptors in the post-synaptic neuron. This has two key effects: 1) More of the same drug is required for the same effects and 2) while not taking the drug the system works at a lower than normal level. Hence some amount of the drug is required for **normal** levels of dopamine.

### The Cholinergic System
The Cholinergic system is another Neuromodulatory system that also has broad and diverse effects. *Acetylcholine* is an important neurotransmitter in the peripheral nervous system but it also plays a neuromodulator role in the brain. As in other system there are relatively few cells but the effects act across a variety of brain areas in the neocortex, hippocampus but also the brainstem and deeper nuclei. These act mainly though the **M1** receptors. A variety of systems like muscle and motor control, learning, short-term memory and general arousal are affected. The *antihistamine* **diphenhydramine** (Benadryl) is an antihistamine that also have potent anticholinergic effects giving many side effects like dry mouth. Off-target effects are common when drugs target multiple Neuromodulatory systems but as individual systems affects many pathways themselves these off-target effects are **the rule** rather than *the exception*. For example more potent anticholinergic drugs can give a limited form of amnesia called **anterograde amnesia**. Here patient fail to remember events that occurred while the drug was in the system. *Scopolamine* is an example of such a drug down from the borrachero treen in Colombia and is even said being around the pollen is enough to give strange dreams. The drugs is also called *devil's breath* and a small amount can cause a dissociative effect leading to a lack of free will along with not remembering the time under the drug.

### Competitive and Noncompetitive
A substance is **competitive** if is binds to the ligand binding site on a receptor preventing the ligand from binding. There can be a sufficient amount of the ligand so it out-competes the drug. **Noncompetitive** describes a drug that binds to a receptor at a location other than the ligand binding site and modifies the receptor in a way that prevents in from binding the ligand.

### The Noradrenaline System
For a maximal effect on target synapses without affecting nearby neuron neuromodulators are released by very specialized populations of neurons in  targeted way. Where the modulatory synapses occur can change the their efficacy either pre or post synapse. *Noradrenaline* is released by very specialized cells in the **locus coeruleus** in the *lateral segmental field*. But acts on the *adrenergic receptors* found in many parts of the brain and peripheral nervous system. It modulates general arousal, fight or flight and the reward system. Being startled or thinking you see something dangerous in the dark you've experienced this system first hand. There are only around 1,500 neuron in each hemisphere. This is a tiny fraction about a millionth of 1%.
