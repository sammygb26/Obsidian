# Neuronal Plasticity
This is one of the key properties of the brain. It's ability change to adapt to the environment. **Neuronal Plasticity** takes place as our brain works. Changes are made by every passing signal which will last our whole lives. It is defines as the brain's ability to change in response to experience. When we do something new, or remember something or change the way we walk due to body changes our nervous system is changing to adapt to this. Much of the wider aspects are still a mystery but the fundamentals of how circuits can changer are understood. We use *plasticity* to refer to changes in neuronal pathways and synapses. All these changes come from changes in our *environment*, *behavior* or even *injury* (body). This plasticity allow us to adapt to our environment faster than evolution allows. This happens on many levels from large scale changes in response to injury or small scale circuit changes in synaptic efficacy.

We classify synaptic plasticity into **short** and **long** term plasticity. *Short-term* plasticity lasts from milliseconds to minutes while *long-term* lasts minutes to hours and even longer.

### Short-Term Plasticity and Adaption
We will focus on short-term mechanisms of plasticity. First there is *short-term strengthening* of synaptic connections, this is known as **synaptic enhancement**. *Short-term synaptic enhancement* results from an increased probability of pre-synaptic neurons releasing neurotransmitters in response to pre-synaptic action potentials. The increase in neurotransmitter release leads to a short term strengthening seen as an increased *excitatory post-synaptic potential*. This is called **synaptic facilitation**. We can also get a short term weakening called **synaptic depression** (also called *synaptic fatigue*). This is usually attributed to depletion of a ready supply of neurotransmitter vesicles in the pre-synaptic neuron after repeated firing. It can also come from post-synaptic processes and feedback activation of pre-synaptic receptors.

These mechanisms can also be talked about in terms of a neuronal circuits **adaptation**. In particular an idea from sensory neuroscience comes in; that its more important to signal *changes* rather than *steady-state*. So seeing something new like a predator may be more important that seeing the floor is still there.

*Adaptation mechanisms* work on short timescales and allow the brain to filter out details that aren't changing. Adaptation can happen through *enhancement* and *depression* as described by also other mechanisms. For example at the level of the **sensory organ** itself or at the level of complex **network dynamics**.

### LTP and LTD
Without longer term plasticity we wont be able to learn more long term things like riding a bike or new concepts. Event simple organisms like flies with lots of relatively hard wired behaviors exhibit significant amounts of learning. There therefore be mechanisms that alter synapses in a sable way lasting a long time even up to a lifetime. Two well describes phenomena leading to this are **Long Term Potentiation** (*LTP*) and **Long Term Depression** (*LTD*). LTP makes synapses *stronger* and LTP makes synapses *weaker*. It was originally found by researchers in Norway studying anesthetized rabbits that when a presynaptic fiber was *strongly stimulated* this would lead to later stimulations having an even greater effect on the post synaptic neuron as **potentiated**, *strengthened*. Then with moderate stimulation no change was seen and with infrequent stimulation the synaptic strength would gradually decrease. Although LTP and LTD they were originally discovered in the *hippocampus* they have been observed in many other neuronal structures like the *cerebral cortex*, *cerebellum*, *amygdala* and many others. It has even been suggested that LTP occurs at every excitatory synapse in the mammalian brain.

### Hebb's Rule and Associative Learning
We know plasticity occurs strengthening or weakening synapses but how does our body know what to strengthen or weaken. We need an *organizing principle* for this. One of the key ideas was laid our by Donald Hebb in 1949. The basic idea being if a cell A repeatedly fires helping to induce a cell B to fire then the strength of the connection will increase such that cell A more and more strongly acts on B. This is known as *Hebb's rule*, Hebbian Theory, Hebb's postulate or **cell assembly theory**. This is simplified as "Neurons that fire together, wire together" and in reverse "neurons our of sync loose their link". This is at is root a kind of *associative learning* to Hebb's rule associates pre and post synaptic neurons and strengthens connections where pre predicts post. This is appealing as it explains many phenomena seen in *human* and *animal* **behavior**. It may not explain all LTP but especially with its connection to the NMDA receptor helps shed a deeper understanding into how the brain works.

### LTP in Depth
We will look at how LTP works. But there isn't just one kind of LTP there are many different mechanisms that can all lead to potentiation of synapses. All LTP leads to *stable changes* in the molecular and structural features in the synapse. This includes the *axonal bouton*, *dendritic spine* and the *proteins of the post synaptic density*. There are three options to increase the strength of a synapse.

1) Make **more neurotransmitter** be released
2) Increase the **number of receptors** on the post-synaptic side
3) Make the post synaptic receptor have a **larger effect**

All of these mechanisms have been observed in nature along with combinations. We can also classify how the LTP was triggered or induced into two categories *Hebbian LTP* and *non-Hebbian LTP*. The first follows the Hebb's rule "cells that fire together wire together" rubric. *Non-Hebbian LTP* and even *anti-Hebbian LTP* are found in the nervous system also. Anti-Hebbian LTP work to the opposite of Hebb's rule pre and post neurons firing together **weakens the connection**. This diversity is through to lead to the diversity in types of learning and computation performed by the brain.

##### NMDA-Dependent LTP
This is the main example of **Hebbian LTP**. This type of potentiation is educed when pre and post synaptic neuron fire in close proximity. What fires together wires together. The *NMDA receptor* is used to implement this. This is a special *glutamate* receptor so named for a substance NMDA which selectively binds to it and not other glutamate receptors. But NMDA isn't natural and was just used to identify the receptor. The complex structure and workings of the NMDA receptor describe how Hebbian plasticity can be implemented.

The NMDA is an *ionotropic receptor* meaning when its open it lets cations and importantly calcium pass through. But it is hard to make it open first it requires *two ligands* both glutamate and glycine must bind. But it is also **voltage gated** on top of being *ligand-gated*. When at rest the NMDA receptor channel accepts a magnesium ion which *blocks* the channels pore. But when depolarized this blocking ion is removed and ions can flow. Hence to open the channel we must **depolarize** the membrane and **activate the channel with neurotransmitters**. This provides a detection for firing together we must *depolarize* the post-synaptic neuron to release the magnesium blockage and we must *activate* the pre-synaptic neuron to release neurotransmitters. To **depolarize** we need the AMPA receptor as the NMDA is harder to open. AMPA receptors are cation selective letting *sodium* and *potassium* through however they also block *calcium* despite positive nature. So these receptors depolarize but don't let calcium through. But *NMDA receptors* let **calcium** through when pre and post synaptic sides are active.

This calcium regulation is important is it is very important and interacts with an enzyme called **CAMK2** or calcium calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II. So the calcium activates two downstream biochemical and metabolic mechanisms. It triggers cascades that phosphorylate (add *phosphate groups* to) the AMPA receptors which makes them open more easily. This is known as *AMPA-receptor phosphorylation* making the receptor more sensitive than normal. A further cascade leads to more AMPA receptors being made and brought to the synapse. This is impressive as simply turning of an on genes works at a cell wide level but these changes take place targeted to synapses. **NMDA Receptor-Dependent LTP** has sever interesting properties.

1) **Input Specificity** once induced the LTP of one synapse doesn't spread to others. It input is specific. This is *critical* as neurons have thousands of synapses and each potentiation is largely independent of others.
2) **Associativity** when insufficient stimulation of one input isn't enough for LTP simultaneous stimulation of another input can induce LTP at both inputs. This comes from how *NMDA receptors* work. As another strong input can depolarize the cell while the neurotransmitters are still present. Even for weak channels.
3) **Cooperativity** weak stimulation of many synapses and action of AMPA receptors can depolarize the cell enabling NMDA receptors at many sites to be activated.
4) **Persistence** this potentiation can last from minutes to hours to months and even longer making this long term.

### LTD in Depth
This counteracts LTP in order to maintain the dynamic range in our nervous system. If we just have LTP eventually we will reach a max where we cannot potentiate any more. **Long-Term Depression** similarly to LTP can last for hours or longer. Typical *Hebbian LTD* is induced by a long period of weak stimulation of the presynaptic neuron that is uncorrelated with post-synaptic firing. This is the "our of sync loose their link" part of Hebb's rule. Again not all LTD is Hebbian. In *Heterosynaptic LTD* for example Neuromodulatory inputs can tell the cell to weaken certain synapses. LTD happens in many areas (**sensory cortex**, **prefrontal cortex**, **hippocampus** and **cerebellum**) but the physiological and biochemical mechanisms for LTD *vary* depending upon *brain regions* and *developmental stages*. They also occur in different types of neurons releasing various neurotransmitters. 

LTD in the **hippocampus** and **cerebellum** are the best understood. The most common neurotransmitter involved is *Glutamate*. It acts through many receptors like AMPA, NMDA ionotropic receptors but also metabotropic glutamate receptor or *mGluRs*. LTD in the *cerebellum* works differently from in the *hippocampus*. In the *cerebellum* LTD results from **strong synaptic stimulation** while in the *hippocampus* LTD results from **persistent weak synaptic stimulation**. In both areas LTD is through to result mainly from decrease in postsynaptic receptor density. This renders the receptors less able to react to neurotransmitters which are being released presynaptically. This is still under study but is understood to be done by *marking* the AMPA receptors to be recycled back into the cell. So **calcium dependent phosphatases** which go about *removing phosphates* (unlike calcium dependent phosphorylation in LTP) play a role in deactivating the target proteins. But is is a mystery how the cells tell the different between small calcium influxes and larges influxes which lead to opposite outcomes.

### Spike Timing Dependent Plasticity
It was found that for many synapses the precise timing of the pre and post synaptic spike at the millisecond level matter for LTP. This phenomena is **spike timing dependent plasticity** or *STDP*. What fires together still wire together and out of sync loose their link but the precise timing matter in defining these terms. Presynaptic spikes arriving a few tens of milliseconds before a post synaptic pike resulted in potentiation while just a few seconds after resulted in depression. With potentiation and depression on the y axis and timing relative to post synaptic potential on the x we get the following.

![[Pasted image 20220617142248.png]]

The strongest *potentiation* occurs just before the post synaptic neuron fires and the strongest *depression* occurs just after. This is through to have evolved to reinforce **causal firing relationships**. If pre fired before post then it could have caused post to fire but the other way around it couldn't have caused it. We don't want to reinforce the random connection which occur randomly in time. There is still much debate about how STDP works to depress signals however it is through that back propagation is responsible for potentiation. That is the *action potential firing* caused the *depolarization* of the dendrites which ultimately caused its firing. This takes a characteristic time dependent on the membrane properties and geometry of the cell. We can imagine the wave of *depolarization* arriving at just the right time to gate the **NMDA receptor**.

### Non-synaptic Plasticity
All the processes we have looked at above look at synaptic plasticity. But there is also **non-synaptic** plasticity which involved changes in the neuron function not involved in one of the many synapses. These changes take place in the *dendrites*, *axon* or *soma* of the neuron. This generally involved changes in ion channel function of these sites. This causes the overall integration of excitatory and inhibitory post-synaptic potentials and so the overall excitability are affected. These mechanisms are called **homeostatic mechanisms**. Since they serve to keep the excitability in some safe operating range. Without this cells firing too much could risk *damaging themselves or others* in the network. Or it can fire too little, not participate and simple waste resources.
