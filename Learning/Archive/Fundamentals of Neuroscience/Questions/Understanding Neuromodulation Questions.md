What is neuromodulation? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation
	**Neuromodulation** is a process by which the synaptic transmission or signaling from one neuron to another is either enhanced or diminished by another third neuron

---
What are neuromodulators? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Neuromodulators are chemicals that affect the signaling over a synapse but are released neither by the pre synaptic neuron but post synaptic neuron. Instead they are released by **neuromodulator neurons**. These chemicals affect the strength of synaptic transmission between the two neurons.

---
In what ways can neuromodulators act? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Neuromodulators usually act through GPCRs to affect the innerworkings of either the pre or post synaptic neuron hence regulating the synaptic interact between the two. They can also act by binding to gated ion channels.

---
What are the two type of changes to synaptic strength in the brain and when do these take place commonly?  #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	These are **structural** and **non-structural**. Structural changes in synaptic strength could be the number of receptors, size of the synapse. This happens normally while growing and in old age. Non-structural changes still affect the efficacy but without structural changes. This happens through **neuromodulation**.

---
What is the efficacy of a synapse?  #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	This is the same as the strength of the synapse.

---
How is the efficacy of a synapse changed via non-structural changes to the synapse?  #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	This happens through **neuromodulation** where a third or fourth (...) neuron act to change the efficacy. This change can have its origin **pre-synaptic** or **post-synaptic**. Pre having its origin in the number of neurotransmitters released and post by altering the response to the neurotransmitters. However these can work together.

What are GPCRs, what are their components? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	GPCRs are a family of proteins complexes making up around 10% of protein coding genes. They all have similar structure although their binding sites have different structure and so bind different ligands.

---
What is the structure of a GPCR protein receptor? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The GPCR protein complex is a transmembrane complex. In the extracellular domain there is a binding site for the ligand. The intracellular domain binds to three G-proteins called alpha, beta and gamma.

---
What are G-proteins? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The G-proteins are bound to the main GPCR proteins which spans the membrane. They are called G-proteins as they bind guanosine triphosphate or GTP.

---
What are the steps for the GPCR complex to function? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	First a ligand binds to the extracellular domain causing a conformity change in the transmembrane protein. The *alpha* subunit can break free of the *beta* and *gamma* subunits. The freed G-proteins can bind enzymes to further affect signaling cascades. For example leading to the production of *cAMP*. This then activates another enzyme called *protein kinase A* or *PKA*. This then activates many other pathways and can affect ion channels opening leading to excitation or inhibition.

---
What are the benefits of the GPCR system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The GPCR system can have **multiple opposing effects on a single target**. For example GPCRs lead to Norepinephrine giving a fight or flight response while acetylcholine gives a rest and digest response. Also second messengers can affect **multiple targets at once**. For example cAMP can lead to ion channel activation, metabolites in the cytoplasm and gene expression in the nucleus. The variety of changes allows for *short and long-term* changes.

What is the serotonin system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The serotonin system is a key Neuromodulatory system in the brain. It is involved in the regulation of mood, apatite and sleep. The dysregulation of this system is involved in disorders such as major depression.

---
Where are serotonergic neurons located in the brain and where are serotonergic receptors located? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	They are located in the **dorsal raphe nucleus** and the receptors can be found in the hippocampus, neocortex, thalamus, amygdala and spinal cord.

---
What are MAOIs and how do they work to combat depression? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	MAOIs or mono-amine oxidase inhibitors work by inhibitory enzymes which break down serotonin (and other molecules). Hence increasing the time serotonin is present and so the number of times it can bind (and so its effect). Increasing the effect of serotonin is through to alleviated the dysregulation that comes in major depression.

---
What are tricyclic antidepressants? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Tricyclic antidepressants are a form of antidepressants that work by targeting the reuptake of serotonin in the synapse. Hence they prolong its time and so its effects. Norepinephrine reuptake is also inhibited which can also affect depression.

---
What are SSRIs and how do they combat depression? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	SSRIs like Fluoxetine and Serotonin work to block serotonin reuptake in the cleft in a more modern targeted way. Serotonin can they have more of an affect and help to combat serotonin dysregulation. Although they act biochemically quickly it make take 4-6 weeks before the effects of depression are seen.

---
What leads to drugs affecting neuromodulators having many side-affects? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The side-affects come from these systems being used to regulate many different system. One neuromodulator may be used in many different parts of the nervous system to signal different things. The specificity is achieved by having neurons control precisely where the neuromodulator is released. Drugs act across the whole body however and so may find it hard to only affect one of these modulated sub-systems.

---
What are neuropeptides? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	These are a class of larger molecules used for neuromodulation and neuronal signaling. They are made out of cleaved proteins and are usually 5-20 peptides long. Over 100 have been discovered from *hypocretin* (used to regulate sleep), *leptin* (used to regulate appetite) and *Substance-P* known to modulate pain. Another class of them are the endogenous opioids.

---
What are opioids and opioid receptors? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Opioids are substances that act on the opioid receptors. These receptors are involved in the downregulation of pain aswell and regulating dopamine in the brain. Endogenous opioids are called endorphins and are released when we are in pain to prevent us going into shock, these are neuropeptides. Natural and synthetic opioids can also be small substances but still bind the same opioids receptors. Hence affecting pain as an analgesic and promoting dopamine release. All opioid receptors are **GPCRs**

---
What are the different opioid receptors? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	These are the mu, kappa, delta and nociception opioid receptors each of which is bound by their own endogenous opioids. But morphine and other opioids bind all of them.

---
What is the dopamine system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	This is a Neuromodulatory system in the brain involved in movement, reward motivated behavior and reinforcement learning.

---
How is the dopamine system related to Parkinson's disease? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	In Parkinson's disease a collection of dopamine neurons from the **substantia nigra** which are involved in movement die of for reasons unknown.

---
What are the four main dopamine pathways? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	These are the mesocortical, mesolimbic, nigrostriatal and tuberoinfundibular pathways.

---
How does dopamine work in the reward and reinforcement learning system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Dopamine neuron in the **ventral tegmental area** or VTA project to the **nucleus accumbens** to give pleasurable feelings. This is the mesolimbic pathway. Dopamine is released here in pleasurable activities like eating, taking drugs or sex. Drugs of abuse like Cocaine work to prevent reuptake of dopamine hence this pleasurable affect is increased.

---
How is dopamine through to be involved in addiction? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	Dopamine regulated pleasure and reinforcement learning to seek that pleasure. We will use something pleasurable again and again therefore but this leads to overall elevated levels of dopamine. The dopamine receptors will become downregulated to compensate for this giving two effects. 1) More of the same thing is required to have the same pleasure 2) not doing the activity leads to a lower than usual dopamine level hence it is required to feel normal.

---
What is the cholinergic system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	The Cholinergic system is a Neuromodulatory system involved in many systems. It acts through the M1 receptor affecting many systems from muscle and motor control to learning, short-term memory and general arousal. Drugs that affect this system therefore have many side effect and wide ranging effects. 

---
What does it mean for a drug to be competitive or non-competitive to a receptor? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	A drug is competitive if it binds to the same site as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter hence the drug can prevent the neuromodulator or neurotransmitter from binding. If one is far more prominent they can out-compete the other preventing it from binding. Non competitive drugs don't work through binding to the usual binding site therefore don't prevent the usual ligand form binding.

---
What is the noradrenaline system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #UnderstandingNeuromodulation 
	This is another Neuromodulatory system involved in the fight or flight response. A very small population of cell in the **locus coeruleus** in the *lateral segmental field* (only around 1,500 in each hemisphere) produce the adrenaline. However the receptors are seen in many areas from the CNS to the peripheral nervous system.
