What are the three major components of the auditory anatomy? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition
	The three major components are the **outer ear**, **middle ear** and **inner ear**.

---
What is the outer ear? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The outer ear also called the *pina* is the section of the ear we can see. It is made out of skin and cartilage On many animals they can move to change which sounds are processed but not in humans.

---
Why does the ear have its folded shape? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	We have two ears allowing us to locate sounds on the same plane but to move of this plan the ear is folded such that sounds form different directions will have certain frequencies removed.

---
What is the main path for sound on its way to be transduced by the inner ear? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The sound is captured by the **pina** and then travels along the **auditory canal**. It then strikes the *ear drum* or **tympanic membrane** which captures the sound and moves it into the middle ear where it moves the **ossicles**, three tiny bones which in turn vibrate against the **oval window** and now finally the **Cochlea** is vibrating.

---
What are the names of the ossicles? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	There are three ossicles the **malleus**, **incus** and **stapes** these are also called the hammer, anvil and stirrup respectively.

---
What is the role of the Cochlea? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The **Cochlea** transduces the sound energy into electrical signals; action potentials for the brain to process.

---
Why does the cochlea have fluid and what problem with this do the ossicles overcome? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The **Cochlea** needs to transduce vibrations into electrical energy and it does this through the movement of *hair cells* a dense fluid is needed to ensure each vibration is truly captured. The problem with this is that if sound waves just entered from the outer ear and hit a fluid (more dense) most of the sound would be reflected instead of getting transduced. To overcome this the ossicles mechanically amplify the sound 30x focusing the ear drum all down onto the oval window.

---
What are the main roles the middle ear performs? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	It transmits sounds from the outer ear to the inner ear amplifying them to ensure soft sounds are heard and less sound it lost to reflection entering the fluid of the inner ear. The muscles in the middle ear can also contract to deeded sounds and so protect the oval window from damaging loud noises.

---
What is the process by which the ossicles amplify a sound called? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This is called **impedance matching** and is done to ensure soft sound can be heard and less sound is lost from reflection coming from entering the fluid of the inner ear form the air.

---
What are the two cases in which the middle ear muscles reduce incoming sound and what is this process called? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This process is called **gating** and it cuased by middle ear muscles contracting to reduce the vibrations of the ossicles. This can happen in a **pre-programmed** way like contracting when we're about to speak to deaden the sound of our voice to not drown our the world around us. It can also happen in a **reflexive** wan in response to loud noises that are either sudden or continuous.

---
What is conduction deafness, can it be treated? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	Conduction deafness is any break in the transmission from sound waves into the inner ear where it can be transduces. So it can be a blockage, ruptured ear drum, broken ossicles. It can be treated by vibrating the inner ear directly or the skull like some headphones.

---
What three parts make up the inner ear and to what systems do these parts belong? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The inner ear is made out of the **semicircular canals**, the **vestibule** and the **cochlea**. The semicircular canals and vestibule belong to the **vestibular system** which is responsible for balance. The cochlea belongs to the auditory system.

---
What are the main cavities and membranes of the cochlea main tube? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	There are three cavities, form the bottom up they are the **Scala Tympani**, the **Scala Media** and the **Scala Vestibuli**. The Scala Tympani is separated form the Scala Media by the **Basilar Membrane** on top of which sits the **Organ of Corti** above this is the **Tectorial Membrane**. The Scala Media is separated from Scala Vestibuli by **Reisner's Membrane**.

---
What are the two fluids present in the inner ear and where are they? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The two fluid present in the inner ear are the **Endolymph** and **Perilymph**. The **Perilymph** is present in the two outer  cavities the Scala Tympani and Scala Vestibuli. While the **Endolymph** is present in the Scala Media.

---
What are the ion compositions of the two inner ear fluids and how is this maintained? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The **Perilymph** is similar to spinal fluid having low concentrations of potassium and high concentrations of sodium. The **Endolymph** on the other hand has ionic concentrations similar to intracellular fluid with high levels of potassium and low levels of sodium. This is maintained by active ion pumps at the **stria vascularis** which lines one wall of the Scala Media. There is about -80mV potential between the two fluids.

---
When the ossicles vibrate how does the inner ear transduce this into sound? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The ossicles move the **oval window** this displaces the **perilymph** in the Scala Vestibuli and Tympani causing the **Basilar Membrane** to vibrate as the sound does. The basilar membrane moves in relation to the **Tectorial Membrane** and so the **Organ of Corti** containing the **hair cells** moves in relation to the tectorial membrane. This moves small hair like structures back and forth causing ion channels to open and close polarizing and depolarizing the hair cells with the sound. This is then taken up by **spiral ganglion** cells which finally produce action potential for the brain. 

---
How do hair cells work to transduce sound? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	They sit in the organ of Corti on the Basilar Membrane which moves as the sound does in relation to the tectorial membrane. Each hair cell is kept in place by **supporting cells** and they produce 60 or so tinny hair like structures called *stereocilia* which make up a hair bundle. As the Tectorial Membrane moves relative to the Basilar Membrane the bundles are moves back and forth. If they stereocilia point toward their tall edge cation selective channels open and close if they point away. These channels are mechanically gated and the cells will therefore hyperpolarize and depolarize in response to sound giving an electrical signal to the brain.

---
What mechanical properties of the Basilar Membrane allow the cochlea to split sound into different frequencies? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The basilar membrane is taut at the base closest to the vestibular system and floppy at the apex closes to the center. This means similar to a guitar string the characteristic frequency of each section is different therefore each vibrates with more or less strength for any sound splitting it into the frequencies that make it up along the length of the cochlea.

---
What is it called when different frequencies are represented as a space in the brain? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This is called a **tone atopic map**.

---
What does the different hair cells being active represent and what does their activity level represent? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	If they are active is means a certain frequency is present but their level of activation represent the level of that frequency. If its louder them more activation.

---
What is sensorineural hearing loss? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This is hearing loss where the inner ear is damaged. Unlike *conduction deafness* it cannot be treated with a hearing aid. This will cause the world to sound muffled or silent.

---
What can cause sensorineural hearing loss? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This can be caused by damage to hair cells, nerves breaking or the fluid in the ear can not be present or working properly.

---
How does a cochlear implant work to solve SNHL? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	The cochlear implant is an electronic device that directly stimulates the auditory nerve. It allows general sounds to be heard and even speak although doesn't give the same hearing we experience.

---
What are the causes of sensorineural hearing loss? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	This can come from illness, infection, toxic drugs, head trauma, exposure, aging and loud noises.

---
What is the path of sound information from the cochlea to the auditory cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	From the **cochlea** the nerves travel to the **Cochlear nucleus** where a tonotopic map is preserved. From here the paths split. One goes to the **superior olive** where signals from both ears are combined. After this both paths join again at the **inferior Colliculus** (just bellow the tectum). After which axons travel to the **Medial Geniculate Nucleus** where the sound is then sent to the **auditory cortex**.

---
What key integration of signals occurs at the superior olive? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	Here signals from both ears first meet and neurons can be found here that pick out timing differences and help to localize sounds.

---
What are the Brodmann area codes in the brain? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	These are given the cytoskeletal structure of the brain after staining how the brain looks under a microscope. The usually don't match functional areas but are still used to describe where thing are in the brain.

---
After the MGN how does auditory signals arrive at the brain? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	They arrive at the primary auditory cortex called A1. Here they arrive in a tonotopic map giving **isofrequency bands** much like the ocular dominance columns in V1.

---
How does processing of sound take place across the auditory cortex A1 and A2? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition
	Similarly to the visual cortex frequencies are first encoded and later these are combined to give small pitch shifts certain notes and loudness levels. In A2 phoneme can be found encodes like pa, ah and da.

---
What are the effects of unilateral and bilateral lesions to the auditory cortex? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	Unlike the visual cortex signals from both ears are sent to both hemisphere of the brain. So unilateral lesions only result in mild hearing loss. Bilateral lesions will result in **cortical deafness**

---
What are the two features of sound signals the ear uses to localize sound? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	It uses interaural time differences ITDs cuased by it taking different times for a sound to reach each ear and interaural level differences ILDs caused by the head blocking part of the sound.

---
How can neurons be wired up to detect ITDs and what special structure ensures this happens reliably? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #Audition 
	Each axon can act like a delay so signals from each ear can be compared such that their action potentials only arrive if the sounds were a given distance apart. Then end neuron acts as a coincidence detector and each one can encode a different difference. The **endbulb of held** is a special structure where the presynaptic process envelopes the post synaptic side. This allows for large transmitter release and uptake giving very reliable signals with little noise unlike elsewhere in the brain.
