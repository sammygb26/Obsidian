What is the neuron doctrine? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits
	The neuron doctrine is the belief that information travels form the dendrites of a neuron to the soma where it is integrated. Then the neuron "decides" if a action potential should be sent. This however leads out that the neurons need to be in circuits to perform any function.

How many synapses go into an average neuron? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	Many thousands of synapses may be integrated into a neuron at once. Many may be overlapping in terms of excitation and inhibition leading to complicated integration and processing step.

What are the five factors that influence how signals are integrated? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	**Synaptic Efficacy and distance** this is basically how strong and far away the synapse is so how much it changes the membrane potential at the axon hillock. **Synaptic Summation** this is how multiple executory signals can "sum up" to give an even stronger signal which increases the change of an action potential being triggered. **Synaptic Inhibition** the signals from a synapse can be shunted and blocked by an inhibitory one. **Temporal Summation** many signals even from the same neuron can be added together if they occur in rapid succession. **Temporal Inhibition** inhibitory synapses effects can be spread over time and influence how temporal summation affects potential.

How does synaptic efficacy and distance affect how a synapse's signal is processed? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits
	The key factor influencing this is the **distance** between the synapse and the cell body. The insight here comes from the same logic as the passive membrane e of the cell. The **length constant** describes how much a signal fall of with distance. Hence a further away synapse will have exponentially lower signal strength. The **shape** of the dendritic spine is also affects this as a thinner spine will have higher axial resistance and so more signal falloff will occur.

How does synaptic summation affect the processing of synaptic signals? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits
	If we have two executory synapses firing independently this will cause small action potentials. If they occur quickly after each other however or at the same time their action potentials will be nonlinearly summed together having together a greater effect on the soma potential.

---
What are some causes for the nonlinearity in signal summation over time? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	**Driving force** basically as one synapse fires the membrane in depolarized causing later synapses to have smaller effects as less of their ions will move due to a smaller driving force being observed. **Dendritic Action Potentials** some dendrites have the right channels to fire their won action potentials adding complexity and non-linearity to signal processing. **Action Potential Back Propagation** the soma can influence the dendrites in the same way the dendrites effect the soma so an action potential can depolarize the dendrites affecting incoming signals. 

---
How does synaptic inhibition effect the processing of executory incoming signals? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	Inhibitory synapses open ion channels with a low reversal potential around -65mV (thanks to chlorine). As this is close to the resting potential they have the effect of clapping the membrane voltage around them to the resting potential. This effect is called **shunting**. This will cause any executory signal further up away from the soma to be blocked by this synapse. Hence why these synapses are placed in blocking positions.

---
How does synaptic temporal summation affect soma membrane potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	When we have two signals in close succession even from the same excitatory synapse. Hence an excitatory synapse on its own can fire an action potential if is fires many signals one after another.

---
How does synaptic temporal inhibition affect soma potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	If a inhibitory synapse fires right before a blocked executory one the downstream synapses effect will be blocked. If a excitatory synapse fires in-between the two excitatory signals the effect of temporal summation will be canceled out.

What are the three main motifs we see in circuits in the nervous system? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	**Convergence** many signal coming together from many places before being processed together to make a decision. **Divergence** a signal from one place having wide ranging effects on a wide array of downstream circuits. **Recurrence** feedback creating more of a state within the system aswell as allowing for cyclic patterns.

---
What is a classic example demonstrating the effects of convergence and divergence? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits 
	This would be the **stretch reflex** or **myotatic or tap reflex**. This is where our knee can be tapped with a hammer provoking out leg to kick out. This caused by convergence of signals from our leg's muscles being stretched out. This converges to a signal motor neuron which diverges to many downstream motor neuron making or top muscle contract and our bottom relax causing our leg to kick out.

What are central pattern generators? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #SmallCircuits
	This is a common spall circuit in many animal used to create rhythmic patters of output. For example in human they exist in the spinal chord and produce patterns like walking. They can be modulated to allow for control and variation from outside signals. This in fact means that most of the processing for complex tasks like waling occurs outside our brain. The simplest pattern generator could e two neurons each connected to the other. A small amount of time from one to the next can lead to one causing the other to fire after a short delay and visa versa.
