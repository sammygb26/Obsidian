What is the main cell structure that gives rise to the action potential? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheActionPotential
	The main cell structure allowing for this are voltage gated ion channels. These change their conformity based on the voltage across the membrane so can amplify and deaden different voltage changes allowing for a signal to be passed.

What are the two voltage gated ion channels involved in the action potential and what are their roles? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheActionPotential 
	This would be the sodium and potassium ion channels. Sodium allows for voltage amplification taking a small change in voltage from -70mV to ~-55mV and with a positive feedback spiking the voltage to ~+30mV. At which point they become inactive. The potassium channels become active around this time allowing potassium to flow out the cell reducing the voltage to go even bellow the resting potential.

What are the phases of the action potential and what causes them? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheActionPotential 
	We have **resting** where we have a resting potential. We have **stimulation** that is a small rise in voltage spreading or created by some external means. We have **rising phase** created by the feedback loop of higher voltage opening sodium channels raising the voltage even more. Then we have a **falling phase** created by the sodium channel becoming inactivated at the same time potassium channels become active. We then have an **undershoot** caused by the rush of potassium out of the cell while this lower voltage takes time to change the conformity of the potassium channels.

What is kinetics and how does this relate to sodium and potassium channels? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheActionPotential 
	Kinetics describes how a chemical system changes probabilistically with time. It therefore describes the different speeds in conformity changes for both sodium and potassium channels. Sodium has fast kinetics and potassium has low kinetics.

What is the refractory period and describe the two types and their causes? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheActionPotential
	The refractory period is a time after the action potential where it is harder to have a new action potential triggered. The two types are absolute caused by sodium channels still being inactive. Here nothing can trigger a new action potential as there can be no feedback loop leading the the rising edge phase. The second type is relative where sodium channels are active again however potassium channels are still open so the voltage is lower than usually because of this more stimulation is needed to trigger a new action potential.
