How can action potential be though of as sending a state signal? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	When our axons send a signal down them it isn't the current the reaches from one side to another as this would be far to hard requiring a massive voltage that is infeasible to maintain over a membrane. Instead a rise in voltage (depolarization) triggers in the next region an action potential. Depolarizing the next state and so on. The absolute refractory period ensures this signal can only move in one direction.

How can action potential propagation be sped up? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	The action potential's movement depends on how quickly a further down patch of membrane can be depolarized allowing for the triggering of a future action potential. This will depend on the length constant bring high (so further away patches get activated by a further away signal which will happen sooner) and a smaller time constant reducing the time it takes for a voltage to become depolarized enough.

What direct properties of the membrane (not time and length constant) can speed up propagation speed and how? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	Propagation speed can be improved by a lower membrane capacitance. As seen from the time constant equation $\tau=R_{mem}C_{mem}$ reducing $C_{mem}$ membrane capacitance will reduce the time constant hence it will take less time for a further away section of membrane to depolarize. Another way is to reduce the axial resistance as this will increase the length constant so further away patches of membrane will depolarize sooner. Again this can be seen from the length constant formula $\lambda=\sqrt\frac{R_{\text{membrane}}}{R_{\text{axial}}}$.

How do squid and similar animals speed up the transition of signals through their bodies? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	They do this with **giant axons** which can be as wide as 1mm many magnitudes more than human axons. This reduces the axial resistance allowing for faster signaling.

What builds up myelin around axons? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation 
	Glia cells wrap myelin around axons in order to speed up the signals being sent.

What happens if two action potential traveling along an axon collide? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	When two action potential traveling along an axon collide we will get an area where an action potential is triggered but on both sides there is an area where no action potential can be triggered caused by the absolute refractory period left by the two which collided. This means the action potential cannot continue on to anywhere so they cancel out.

What happens if we stimulate an axon in the middle? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation
	If we stimulate the middle of an axon that area will depolarize. Causing both areas of the membrane to the left and right to depolarize. These depolarized regions will have action potential triggered within them and so depolarizing membrane further away from the site of stimulation. Overall this will cause two action potential to travel in opposite direction away from the stimulation.

How does Myelin speed up signal propagation along axons? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation 
	Myelin acts increases the width of the membrane in at least the extent to which is functions as a dielectric in a capacitor over the membrane. Increasing the width of the dielectric causes a reduction in capacitance speeding up the signals.

What problem is create if we just wrap axon's whole length in myelin? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation 
	Myelin improve signal propagation speed however it also reduces permeability of the membrane by blocking the ion channels as it is an insulator. Therefore if we had a axon wrapped entirely in Myelin it would mean from one end an action potential would quickly depolarize along the axon (through not very far). However no action potential could be triggered by this as the sodium ion channels opening could cause a massive gain in voltage due to the Myelin blocking the channels. So the signal wouldn't move down the axon.

How is the problem of myelin blocking action potentials solved by the body and what is the name of this motion of the signal? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation 
	To solve this problem gaps in the myelin are created each called a node of Ranvier. At these points there are high concentrations of the voltage gated ion channels. This means when one node experiences and action potential the signal quickly works along under the myelin and just reaches the next node allowing it to become depolarized enough to have it own action potential boosting the signal again allowing the next node to be reached. This is called *saltatory conduction*.

---
What can happen when myelin is destroyed or damaged in humans? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #ActionPotentialPropogation 
	If there isn't enough channels remaining in the gap (or they are inactivated by any remaining myelin) the signal may not be strong enough to reach the next node. Hence it will stop and the axons will be unable to transmit a signal.
