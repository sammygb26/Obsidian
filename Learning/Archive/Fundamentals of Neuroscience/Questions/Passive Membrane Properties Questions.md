What are the two types of resistance we care about in a neuron? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	We care about the axial resistance along the axon and the membrane resistance across the membrane. We measure these resistances is Ohms per mm or some length measure.

What component does the membrane act like when we consider charge build up across it? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	It acts like a capacitor filling up with charge to a given capacitance. In this arrangement the membrane acts as the diametric.

What is the length constant? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	The length constant describes how quickly a voltage along the axon falls of passively. This is due to the voltage either flowing along the axon being resisted by the axial resistance or out across the membrane resisted by the membrane resistance. The length constant itself describes how far approximately it will take for 37% of the voltage to fall of. It is equal to $\lambda=\sqrt{\frac{R_{\text{membrane}}}{R_{\text{axial}}}}$

What affects capacitance of a capacitor? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	The capacitance of a capacitor is affected by the thickness of the dielectric (thicker lower capacitance) and the material of the dielectric. A material with higher dielectric constant (which depends on how easily polarized it is) will have a higher contestant.

What is the time constant? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	The time constant describes how long it takes the membrane to change its voltage to its eventual voltage. As the "capacitor" created over the membrane fills up. It is therefore described by the membrane resistance and the capacitance of the membrane. $\tau=R_{mem}C_{mem}$

What role does Myelin play in an axon simply? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #PassiveMembraneProperties 
	Myelin thickens the cell membrane thereby thickening the "dielectric" part of the capacitor formed over the membrane. This will decrease the capacitance thereby reducing the time constant making signals propagate faster.
