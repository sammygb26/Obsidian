What is a synapse? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse
	The synapse is the signaling connection between two neurons. It is where the action potential from one neuron can influence another.

What are the kinds of synapses? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	The two types of synapse are an electrical synapse and a chemical synapse.

---
What is a electrical synapse, how does it work and what are its features? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	The electrical synapse in one of the two kinds of synapse. They function as pores between the two neuron allowing with a permeable layer allowing ions to travel between the neurons hence allowing a current and so the action potential to move form one neuron to another. This creates high synchronicity between neurons as one signal is likely to directly create another. These connections can also be multidirectional as ions flow in both directions.

What is a chemical synapse, what are its parts and the gist of how it works? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	The chemical synapse is the more common of the two kinds of synapse. It is a connection between an upstream/presynaptic neuron (which the signal comes from) and a downstream/postsynaptic neuron (which the signal goes to).  The synapse is made out of the presynaptic terminal (larger area process form the axon) the synaptic cleft (a regulated space in between 20-40nm) and the postsynaptic terminal (larger process detecting signals from in the cleft). This works through having the presynaptic terminal release neurotransmitters and neuromodulators into the cleft which are then registered and detected by corresponding receptors in the postsynaptic terminal.

What are neurotransmitters and neuromodulators? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	Neurotransmitters are chemicals that directly increase or decrease the likelihood of firing.  Neuromodulators have more wide ranging activity and generally modulate neuron activity past purely firing.

---
What are the steps for a chemical synapse transmitting a signal? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	For a chemical synapse to transmit a signal first an action potential travels down the axon to the synapse. The presynaptic terminal is then triggered to release neurotransmitters or neuromodulators into the cleft form vesicles. They then diffuse across the cleft and bind to receptors in the postsynaptic terminal. The receptors then affect functioning in the post synaptic neuron.

---
What are the two kinds of receptors in the post synaptic terminal? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	These are ionotropic receptors that allow a single ion or class of ions to pass through the membrane once bound hence affecting membrane potential directly. There are then metabotropic receptors that set of complex chains of actions and molecular cascades within the cell.

---
In what context was the inner workings of the presynaptic terminal first uncovered? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	It was first uncovered looking at the Neuromuscular junction or NMJ. This is the connection between nerve cells (specifically motor neurons) and muscle cells.

---
When a neuron is stimulated  creating an action potential what is the response of the downstream neuron called and also what is the analogy of thin in muscles? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse
	The response is called a postsynaptic potential or PSP. These can either be excitatory (EPSPs) increasing the voltage or inhibitory (IPSPs) decreasing the voltage. This is different in the connection to muscles. The flat structure formed between a nerve and muscle fiber is called an end plate. The potential is therefore called an end plate potential EPP.

---
How were PSPs found to be quantized and what did this suggest about the release of neurotransmitters?
	By stimulating a neuron a PSP can be observed in a downstream neuron. There are also mini PSPs which aren't caused by any stimulation. When the levels of calcium are reduced it can be seen that PSPs occur in multiples of the mini size. This lead to the realization that the stimulating agents (neurotransmitters) are released in quanta. The smallest of which is a mini which is randomly released. But when the terminal is depolarized calcium flowing in causes more quanta to be released causing signal to propagate.  This lead to the hypothecation of vesicles.

---
What is a vesicle? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	A vesicle is a small structure made our of cell membrane (lipid bilayer).  It contains a quantity of a chemical it can release but keeps separate form the cytoplasm. In the context of a presynaptic terminal it will be packed with a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator.

---
What role to calcium channels play in a chemical synapse? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse
	Calcium channel's opening is stimulated by depolarization of the membrane caused by an action potential. They are concentrated around the presynaptic terminal and cause calcium to flow into the cell. Its primary role isn't to change the membrane potential however but instead to find to SNARE proteins allow vesicles to release their contents into the synaptic cleft.

---
How was the vesicle/quant hypothesis proven and what did this show about vesicles? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	It was finally proven with the use of electron microscopes which have high enough detail to see structures as small as vesicles. This showed there were two populations of vesicles ones that were docked ready to release and ones that were waiting to be loaded.

---
What are SNARE proteins? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	SNARE proteins are used to merge vesicles with the cell wall. That is to release their contents. They are highly conserved across different organisms so evolutionarily important.

---
What are the two kinds of SNARE proteins by where thye bind to? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	There are vesicle associated proteins or t-SNARE proteins. These bind to target SNARE proteins associated with the membrane. The common v-SNARE is  Synaptobrevin while SNARE-25 and Syntaxin are the main t-SNARE ones.

---
How do SNARE proteins work to use calcium to regulate vesicle release? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
	They bind calcium changing their conformity. It bind to Synaptotagmin to speed up vesicle release.

---
	How do Botulinum and Tetanus work to prevent vesicle release and so cause nerved t not function? #flashcard #FundamentalsOfNeuroscience #TheSynapse 
		They do this by cleaving SNARE proteins inactivating them and removing their ability to release the vesicles.
