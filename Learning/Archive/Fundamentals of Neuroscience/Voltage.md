# Voltage
Voltage is the difference in **electrical potential** between two points. This is similar to **gravitational potential** and in the same way it it what influences what direction a charged particle will move in and with what force.

The **electrostatic force** is similar to the gravitational force but for charges. Here like repel and opposites attract.

We can get an understanding of electrical potential looking at this, as a charge will move depending on how positive or negative an area is and so the **voltage** between the two areas.

In **neuroscience** the areas we care about are the inside and outside of the cell, separated by a membrane. This membrane doesn't allow charges to flow across without **pumps**. Then channels allow the charges to flow creating a **voltage**. The impermeability maintains the voltage.

## Measuring Voltage
Voltage is relative, you have to measure it relative to some reference level. in **neuroscience** this is always the outside of the cell. So if the inside is 50mV more negative the voltage difference is -50mV.
