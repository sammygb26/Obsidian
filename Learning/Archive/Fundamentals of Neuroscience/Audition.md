# Audition
**Audition** is our sense of hearing and plays an important role making up for the shortcomings of *vision* like things being behind us, out of view or hidden.

### The Nature of Sound
*Sound waves* are produced when something vibrates causing a disturbance in the surrounding medium (air, water). These create disturbance sin pressure in the medium. The medium itself doesn't actual move that would be wind. The **energy** in the disturbance is what is transmitted. Lower notes are lower frequency and the reverse for higher. As the density is what is changing this is called a **rarefaction wave**.

These waves travel at the speed of sound which is around $343ms^{-1}$ this is fast but no where near as fast as light waves. But we also break the speed of sound with our vehicles today, like a fighter plane moving at Mach 2 (twice the speed of sound). The *amplitude* of the pressure variations is what makes a sound loud or soft. The *pitch* of a sound depends on the sound fast vibrations leads to the pressure waves being close together. But low pitch sound comes from low sounds. We hear at a range of (20-20000Hz) where Hz = waves per second. **Speech** only takes up from 20-2000. Human hearing isn't amazing aswell with many animals having far greater range. With bats and dolphins hearing up to 100000 Hz.

### Auditory Anatomy
Just as light sound must be transduced into sound. So we take mechanical energy to receptors to finally produce electrical signals. There are three components that perform this task together. The **outer ear**, the **middle ear** and the **inner ear**.

![[Pasted image 20220629142739.png]]

The *outer ear* also called the **pina** is what we call the ear. The piece of skin on the side of your hear. They are made out of cartilage and skin and reflect sound into our ears. They collect sound into the ear and in many animals can move to capture sound form different areas but in humans this isn't the case. The *pina* has an unusual shape with its folded structure, this is thought to help us locate if sounds are up and down as different directions will filter different sounds. Having *two* ears we use triangulation in locate sounds in the plane. But for up and down the shape is used. Many animals do this differently for example *owls* have asymmetric feather patterns on their faces. After the pina the airwaves travel towards the middle ear through an *air-filled* canal which extends about two and a half centimeters into the skill. This is called the **auditory canal**.

After this the waves reach the *ear drum* also called the **tympanic membrane** causing it to move in and out at the same speed as the wave. In the *middle ear* then the sound is transmitted through an air filled space by the **ossicles** meaning little bones and these are the smallest bones in the human body. 

![[Pasted image 20220629143404.png]]

There are three *ossicles* the **Malleus**, the **Incus** and the **Stapes** also called the *hammer*, *anvil* and *stirrup*. The *Malleus* is attached to the tympanic membrane and it causes the *Incus* to move which then causes the *Stapes* to move.

![[Pasted image 20220629143602.png]]

The *foot plate* of the stapes is attached against the second membrane covering the *oval window* which is a small whole in our skull bone. As the *stapes* vibrates against this membrane it creates waves inside the **Cochlea** which corresponds to waves in the air proper. The *Cochlea* is what transduces the vibrations into electrical signals for the brain.

![[Pasted image 20220629143911.png]]

The **Cochlea** is a coiled structure made up of the *Basilar Membrane* which will vibrate in response to sound. Attached to the membrane are neurons called *Hair Cells* that transduce mechanical movements into electrical signals. The fluid in the *Cochlea* is moved as the membrane moves so moving the hair cells.

![[Pasted image 20220629144130.png]]

It is thought that the *cochlea* has fluid which is more dense than air hence the signals will be more on point. But we cannot have the waves from the air to the cochlea directly as much of them would be reflected hence why the middle ear and *ossicles* are needed. The **ossicles** are structured so they take in some pressure wave and increase the output by a factor of 30. This process it called **impedance matching**. It not only combats loss due to reflection but also amplifies soft sounds. The ear picks up a wide range of sounds from our surrounding but the ossicles concentrate this into the oval window. This also means the inner ear is protected from loud outside noise in a process called **gating** muscles in the inner ear can reduce the efficiency so the sound traveling through is even weaker than before. The muscles contract and physically reduce the vibrations of the ossicles. This happens in two ways *pre-programmed* for example the muscles contract before you speak so that other sounds aren't drowned out and also *reflexive* in response to a loud noise either sudden or continuous.

### Conduction Deafness
For sensory neurons to send signals the sound must first be transferred to the inner ear. If this is blocked you get **conductive hearing loss**. This can come from anything blocking your ear, breaking the *tympanic drum* or ossicles. With this kind of hearing loss you can bite down on what it making the noise or to vibrate the skull bypassing the conductance pathway. Some headphones do this so that external sounds can't be heard. You can test if someone has this kind of deafness and use external aids to help them hear.

### The Inner Ear
The inner ears is responsible for some other function other than hearing. The inner ear is a body cavity consisting of several parts; the *Vestibule*, the *Semicircular canals* and the *Cochlea*. The *vestibule* and *semicircular canals* belong to the **vestibular system** responsible for balance while the *cochlea* is responsible for hearing.

![[Pasted image 20220629152202.png]]

The **Cochlea transforms** sound energy into neuronal activity and is the lain word for snail. But this is only the size of a pea. If we unfurl it we would get a long tube that diminishes along it length and is coiled around an axis. The *main tube* consists of three liquid filled tubes the top is called the *Scala Vestibuli*, the bottom the *Scala Tympani* and the middle the *Scala Media* where Scala means staircase. These Vestibuli and Media are separated by *Reisner's membrane* while the Tympani and Media are separated by the *Basilar Membrane*. Then on top of the *Basilar Membrane* is the **Organ of Corti** while on top of that is the *Tectorial Membrane*.
 
![[Pasted image 20220629152601.png]]

There are two fluids in the Cochlea **Endolymph** and **Perilymph** their ionic concentrations are important to allow *hair cells* to transduce. The *Tympani* and *Vestibuli* both contain *Perilymph* while the *Media* contains *Endolymph*. The **Perilymph** is similar to spinal fluid with low potassium and high sodium while the **Endolymph** can be seen as quite strange containing ion levels similar to intracellular fluid despite being extracellular so it is high in potassium and low in sodium. The concentration differences is generated by active transport of ions at the **stria vascularis** which lines one wall of the *Scala media*. There is an electrical potential of about +80mV between *endolymph* and *perilymph*.

### Physiology of the Cochlea
The basic idea is sound vibrate the *tympanic membrane* moving the *ossicles* such that the *Stapes's* foot vibrates against the *oval window*. This displaces the **perilymph** in the *Scala vestibuli* and *tympani* causing the **Basilar Membrane** to vibrate.  When the **Basilar Membrane** moves in relation to the *tectorial membrane* there is a shearing force on the **hair cells** of the *organ of Corti*.This causes ion channels in the hair cell to open or close depolarizing and hyperpolarizing the cell respectively. So they transduce a mechanical force to electrical signal. So over all sound waves vibrate bones, which vibrate fluid, which causes membrane to fluctuates, causing cells to move, causing ion channels to open finally causing depolarization. We can look at how the hair cells actually work more in depth.

They are anchored in the **basilar membrane** and is surrounded by a non sensory supporting cell. At the top of the *hair cell* are 60 or so tiny hair like structures called *stereocilia* which together make up a *hair bundle*. The *stereocilia* are attached to the bottom of the *Tectorial Membrane*. Hence when a sound wave makes the *basilar membrane* vibrate relative to the *tectorial membrane* the *stereocilia* tilt either toward or away from the tall edge of the hair bundle. When the **stereocilia** are tilted *towards* their tall edge from the sheering force a set of non-selective cation channels poem and when tilting *away* these same channels close.  These channels are *mechanically gated* opened by a push or pull. Hence the cells will depolarize and hyperpolarize in response to how the *basilar membrane* is moving in response to each sound. These action potential changes cause the hair cells to release *neurotransmitters* which final causes depolarization and spiking of cells in a structure called the **spiral ganglion**. Then these signals are carried to the brain on the auditory nerve which is a bundle of axons passing through the brainstem where the signals are relayed through many weigh stations before making their way to the **auditory thalamus** and then **cortex**.

### Frequency Detection
Sounds are made up of complex patters of high and low frequencies but when these arrive at the ear they are all mixed up together. Before they can be analyzed we must be able to detect individual frequencies. This is accomplished through the *mechanical properties* of the **Basilar Membrane**. These properties vary along the length of the *cochlea*. At the base the membrane is *thin* and **taut** but moving towards the apex is is more and more *broad* and **floppy**. This parts then vibrate differently based on the frequencies in the sound. The broad floppy parts respond best to *low frequencies* while the thin taut parts respond best to high frequencies.

![[Pasted image 20220630113954.png]]

As this property is moved across space it is called a **tone atopic map** and is the same just how vision is array across the retina in a *retinotopic map*. The base of the membrane in dunes to the highest frequencies of around ~20kHz while the apex is tunes to the lowest at ~20Hz. Because of this mapping the *hair cells* at any given point are sensitive to a specific frequency in a process called **place coding**. The frequency is encoded by which neuron is active not how active they are. The loudness is encoded by the level of activity of the hair cells.

### Sensorineural Hearing Loss
*Conduction deafness* affects the sound getting to the inner ear but **sensorineural hearing loss** occurs when components of the inner ear are damage. This results in loss or muffled sense of hearing. It could be the hair cells, nerves the break. SNHL is the most common type of permanent hearing loss and cannot be medically or surgically corrected. Sometimes SNHL can be treated with a cochlear implant. These work different from a hearing aide instead of just amplifying sounds cochlear implants are complicated electronic devices that *collect*, *process* and *arrange sound* they then **directly stimulate** auditory nerves. People with cochlear implants cannot hear the same as normal hearing but can hear major sounds around them and even speech.

There can be many causes of *sensorineural hearing loss* from genetic running in families or miscoded gene can disrupt proper inner ear development. From the environment *illness*, *infection*, *toxic drugs*, *head trauma*, *exposure*, *aging* and *loud noises* can cause inner ear damage. This can be diagnosed with audiograms that show which areas hearing loss is present in. Because of the **tone atopic map** knowing what part of the spectrum the loss is in can tell you where the damage is.

### Subcortical Auditory Pathways
After *transduction* the information must travel to the brain. The *hair cells* send their signals to **spiral ganglion cells** which project out **auditory nerves** to a sequence of *nuclei* in the brainstem before reaching the *midbrain*, *thalamus* and then *auditory cortex*. The **cochlear nucleus complex**, **cochlear nucleus** or **CN** is a structure located on the dorsolateral side of the brainstem. It spans the junction of the pons and medulla. It consists of two heterogeneous collection of neurons whose *inputs* come from the **cochlear nerve** and whose *outputs* go to higher regions of the auditory brainstem. The innervation of cochlear nerves match the **spatial organization** along the basilar membrane. This forms an organized network based on the frequencies of each nerve. This is another example of **Tonotopy**. These kind of maps are present all over the auditory system up and into the *auditory cortex*. After the **cochlear nucleus** the path splits with one set going to the **superior olive**. This is where signals from both ears are first integrated and specialized groups of cells in distinct regions of the olive encode differences in intensity and loudness aswell as timing differences.

![[Pasted image 20220630123947.png]]

From the **superior olive** the sounds are sent to the *inferior colliculus* (the *superior colliculus* is the optic tectum). Just as the tectum the inferior colliculus allows us to orient ourselves in response to auditory signals. The second set of nerves leaving the **Cochlear Nucleus** goes directly to the Inferior Colliculus. After the *inferior colliculus* the nerves go to the **Medial Geniculate Nucleus** which is in the thalamus and is the auditory equivalent of the LGN. It made up of a number of cell types in layers which perform specialized functions to process sound. It is also thought to play a role in allowing us to maintain attention on some sound.

### Auditory Cortex
From the **MGN** auditory information goes to the *auditory cortex*. The auditory cortex is also likely where the sound is perceived but conscious perception is still hard to study. The *primary auditory cortex* is located bilaterally in the temporal lobes; near Brodmann areas 41 and 42. The Brodmann area codes are given by cytoarchitecture, how they look under a microscope when strained by different chemicals, they don't strictly correspond to functional divisions but make a useful reference frame. The structure of *primary auditory cortex* strongly resembles that of visual cortex. Much like **V1** the primary visual cortex **A1**
is organized in layers. With Layer 1 containing few  cell bodies, with layers 2 and 3 containing small pyramidal neurons. Layer 4 is where axons from MGM synapse and is densely packed with *granule cells*. Layer 5 and 6 again contain mostly Pyramidal neurons although larger than 2 and 3. Each **A1** cell is tuned to a specific sound frequency in the audible spectrum. This again is a tonotopic map that begins in the *basilar membrane* of the cochlea is carried through to the auditory cortex. This gives columns that respond to similar frequencies. These are called **isofrequency bands**.

![[Pasted image 20220630125334.png]]

Low frequencies are analyzed by neurons at the rostral and lateral ends while high frequencies are analyzed by the caudal and medial ends. It's clear that cells in *auditory cortex* have *receptive fields* just like in visual cortex but here they respond to specific auditory features like frequency change rather than visual patterns. But some are also tuned to intensity and types of sound like clicking and animals. Just like ocular dominance some neurons only respond to one ear. There are also other regions that process auditory signals like **A2** which responds well to elementary parts of words called *phonemes* like ah, pa and da etc. The entire audition sensing system is *bilateral* meaning it is replicated on both sides of the brain. This gives the system resilience you can loose cortex on one side and can still hear. Unilateral lesions lead to only slight hearing loss but bilateral ones lead to **cortical deafness**. 

### Localizing Sound
Our ear can derive frequency information from a sound but another key aspect is *localization* telling where a sound is coming from. Having two ears plays a critical role in allowing this kind of localization which is important to hone in on one sound. Our ears rely on some complementary mechanisms to accomplish this. The first relies on the *speed of sound* only **340m/s**. This is fast but is means the sound will reach the ears at different times for something one one side the far ear will take about half a millisecond longer to reach. This is called and **interaural time difference** or *ITD*. This isn't a long time as action potentials themselves can take milliseconds so fine tuned mechanisms are required. One such structure is the **Endbulb of Held** which is a huge synapse where the *presynaptic process* envelopes the *postsynaptic* side. This allows a lot of neurotransmitter to be released and received by many receptors. This gives fast faithful transmission. These are through to be in a clever arrangement that allows them to best detect *ITDs*.

![[Pasted image 20220630132301.png]]

As axons act like delays we can arrange their lengths such that each target neuron corresponds to a certain value then neurons are then coincidence detectors firing only for certain ITDs. Therefore some will respond to sounds from the right and some to the left. This can even be done with differences in peak timing of waves on each side of the ear form a constant source. This gets trickier from higher frequencies so another method is used. **Interaural Level Differences** *ILDs* uses two key factors sound get less intense with *distance* and when something is *obstructing* say our head. The head casts a sound shadow allowing the head to localize the sound this way. *LTDs* and *ILDs* allow for triangulation but with only two ears there is a problem sound in front and behind will have the same ITDs and LTDs! Even then it is hard to tell if something is above or below there are many points that will give the same measurements. This is where the odd shape of the ear comes in. The strange way the sound is modulated by the ear allows the brain to tell in elevation where the sound is coming from.
