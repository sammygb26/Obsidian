# The Synapse
We have looked at the membrane and action potentials but this doesn't give a complete understanding of how they give rise to action, thought and processing. The **synapse** is important for sending output form the cell and so communication between neurons. The **dendrite** takes is important to take in information into the neuron. They have  a tree like structure that gives them their name. The dendrite passes information onto the cell body and if it becomes depolarized enough an action potential travels down the axon. Hence neurons are *polar* (in an information sense) since information comes in one size and out the other. This then moves onto another neuron and so on. The site itself if called a **synapse**. There are two types *chemical synapses* and *electrical synapses*. 

#### Electrical Synapses
These are simpler to understand than chemical ones although less common in human nervous system. These are basically pores that allow ions to travel from one neuron to another. Creating a current flowing into the downstream neuron. They are not just like as neurons being connected together.  These allow signals to pass through without much change and therefore create a high degree of *synchronicity* between neurons. These are also much faster to operate and allow for *multidirectional* information flow $A\to B$ and $B\to A$.

#### Chemical Synapse
These are more complicated. The signal isn't simple passed along. Instead the action potential causes a chemical to be released (by the upstream (presynaptic) cell) into a small space in between the neurons called the **synaptic cleft** (20-40nm is size, small). The other side of the cleft the downstream (post synaptic) neuron takes up the signal converting it into another electrical signal it can then transmit. The chemical signal travels from one side to another through diffusion. Although it can have another affect on the neuron. It can therefore have a more diverse range of affects on the downstream neuron and allows for more expressive communication. It does take more time for this signal to travel however. These synapses are *unidirectional*. The chemical synapse decouples the electrical signal incoming from outgoing so unlike in an electrical synapse and action potential may or may not fire. It may therefore require multiple signals close in time to fire. This gives a notion of *summation* that is important for neurons computational properties.

Some chemical signals tell the post synaptic neuron to increase or decrease their likelihood of firing. These are called **neurotransmitters**. There is another category including dopamine, serotonin and epinephrin (adrenalin) which have more wide ranging effects. These are called **neuromodulators** and they modulate neuron activity.

#### Anatomy of the Synapse
This will refer to *chemical synapses*. There are two neurons **presynaptic** and **postsynaptic**. The *presynaptic* neuron outputs a signal and the *postsynaptic* takes in and transmits a signal. The space in between is the **synaptic cleft** which is only 20-40nm in distance. It is also not just open to space and its structure, shape and connection is determined by adhesion molecules. The chemical content is regulated by an assortment of molecular machines. The axon of the presynaptic neuron balloons out as it gets close to the postsynaptic neuron. This is called the *presynaptic terminal*. The steps for a signal to transmit are

1. An *action potential* travels down the axon to the synapse
2. The signal at the presynaptic terminal *releases neurotransmitters* or *neuromodulators* into the cleft. These will be in vesicles.
3. The action potential causes the vesicles (which are made out of the same material as the cell membrane) to fuse with the membrane and release the contents into the cleft.
4. The neurotransmitters and neuromodulators move across the membrane and then  bind to *receptors* on the other side of the cleft in the postsynaptic terminal. 

These receptors bind to very a  specific molecule or class of molecules. They create some change in the post synaptic neuron when they change.  Some receptors are themselves ion channels called *ionotropic receptors*. These can allow a single ion or class of ion to pass through the membrane once the receptor has been bound to. This is therefore one way a signal can move form one neuron to another. Not all receptors are this type however some set of complex chain of actions and molecular cascades withing the cell. These can even alter gene expression within the cell and are called *metabotropic receptors*.

#### The Presynaptic Terminal
We will cover how the machinery of the presynaptic terminal functions. This was discovered by Bernard Katz in the 1950s. This was first explored by looking at the *Neuromuscular junction* or NMT. This is a simpler connection but is far easier to record.

The primary neurotransmitter used at the NMJ is acetylcholine. The first experiments just measured the timings of the presynaptic neuron and postsynaptic neuron.  An electrode is places before the synapse and after (one to stimulate and one to record).

The response of the post synaptic neuron is called the **postsynaptic potential** also said as **PSP**. These are classified into different categories. *Excitatory* where the neuron is more likely to fire after or *inhibitory* the neuron is less likely to fire after.

Another term used for *excitatory* postsynaptic potentials is **EPSPs** and the duel for *inhibitory* is **IPSPs**. In the neuromuscular junction the terms can be different. Where the nerves meat the muscle fibers a flat structure is formed called *end plates*. Hence the potentials are called **end plate potentials** or **EPPs**. So to understand how synapses worked we can measure EPSPs, IPSPs and EPPs while varying conditions around the neuron. The breakthrough for Katz came when considering blips found between neuron stimulation in the post synaptic side. By adding the drugs Curare and Neostigmine to the environment which block acetylcholine and prevents quick breakdown of acetylcholine respectively. Hence Curare blocks the EPPs and Neostigmine amplifies the EPPs. The blip themselves are caused by spontaneous release of neurotransmitters into the cleft from the presynaptic terminal. Another clue is that the blips or minis were all the same size. This wouldn't be expected if the neurotransmitter was just released into the clef continuously.

Katz varied the concentrations of calcium around the synapse to see the result. The size of the EPPs depended strongly on the concentrations of calcium when the EPP was observed. It was also found that the calcium needed to be present before stimulation of the presynaptic neuron otherwise nothing would happen. The concentration of calcium is in fact *highly controlled* within the cell and is important to *cell signaling*. It was found the under low calcium concentrations a histogram of the EPP amplitudes observed showed  EPPs occurred in multiples of the mini EPP sizes either the same twice the size or even no EPP. This lead Katz to hypothesis that the neurotransmitters were released in approximately the same quantity. That is the process is *quantized*. To the minis came from one package or quanta of the neurotransmitter and the EPPs came from one or more quanta. This can only be seen with low calcium concentrations however as only a few quanta are released.

Overall what was found then is an arriving action potential triggered **calcium channels** to flood the cell. This made the release of neurotransmitters more likely.

#### Visualizing the Synapse
The quanta hypothesis gave the idea that in the synapse vesicles were released containing neurotransmitters in a fixed amount. This wasn't proven until the vesicles were seen however as light microscopes don't have the resolution to see structures inside the synapse as they are only a few nanometers in diameter. **Electron microscopes** resolved this problem. This showed small sphere inside the terminal and omega bodies created when they fused to the cell membrane. It was also seen that the number of sphere was depleted after heavy stimulation. 

Researchers also found there were two populations of vesicles. Ones that were *docked* and ones that were waiting to be *loaded*.

#### SNAREs
We know that calcium triggers vesicles to be released and know the existence of vesicles to be proved. But how does calcium have its effect on the vesicles. This function is performed by **SNAREs**. These are proteins that are are found in the synapse that are highly conserved in structure and function across many different organisms, hence its evolutionarily important. The SNARE proteins on the vesicle and on the presynaptic membrane modulated by calcium lead to vesicle fusion. These same mechanisms are involved through the body when there is a need to traffic molecules or nutrients between organelles inside the cell.

The vesicle associated SNARE proteins or **v-SNAREs**  catalase a reaction with target SNARE proteins on the cell membrane called **t-SNAREs**. The main v-SNARE is Synaptobrevin while SNARE-25 and syntaxin are the main t-SNAREs. Other proteins bring the v and t SNAREs together, power their interaction and separate them afterwards via a zippering mechanism to overcome an energy barrier. The interaction between the SNARE proteins is modulated by calcium. *Voltage dependent calcium channels* let it in when the axon depolarizes hence calcium flows in at the presynaptic terminal. The calcium binds to Synaptotagmin which speeds up vesicle release. Hence the release of the vesicles depends on calcium concentrations.

Botulinum (Botox) and Tetanus (Tetanus) cleave snare proteins hence inhibit the release of acetylcholine. Vesicles are also *recycled* after use.
