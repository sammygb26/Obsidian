What is the master theorem used for? #flashcard  #IADS #TheMasterTheorem
	The master theorem is used to examine the aptotes of recursive algorithms. It examines the number of sub problems proportional to the size decrease of the problem and the work done in each function without recursion. That is the three steps in divide and conquer (divide(number of sub problems and size), conquer(work done before recursive call) and combine(work done after recursive call)).

What is a recurrence relationship? #flashcard  #IADS #TheMasterTheorem
	A recurrence relationship defines the asymptotic action of a single function call within a recursive solution. It define a function in terms of itself called on a smaller value. The key parts are a number of called to itself but with a smaller size an amount of work done asymptotically within the function and a base case where the recursion bottoms out.
