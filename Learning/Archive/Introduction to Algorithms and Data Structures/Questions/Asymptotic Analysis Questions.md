What does it mean for f=o(g)? #question 
	No matter how much we scale up f there will always be some value of n where g will grow larger than f.

What doe sit mean for f=w(g)? #question 
	No matter how much we scale up g at some point f will always overtake it for large enough values of n.

---
What does it mean for f=O(g)? #question 
	This means f is asymptotically bounded above by g. That is there is some amount we can scale up g such that after a certain value of n g will remain above f.

---
What does it mean for f=W(g)? #question 
	This means f is asymptotically bounded bellow by g. That is there is some amount we can scale down g such that after a given value of n it will always remain bellow f.

---
What does it mean for f=0(g)? #question 
	This means f is asymptotically bound to g. There is some value we can scale down g and some value we can scale it up such that after a certain value of n f will always remain in-between these two versions of g.

Why is n!=O(2^(n/2)) and n!=Theta(2^n)? #flashcard #IADS #PnNP 
	For $n>4$ we have $2^{n}<n!<2^{2n}$ hence $n!=\Omega(2^n)$ and $n!=O(2^{2n})$
