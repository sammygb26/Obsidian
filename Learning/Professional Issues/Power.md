# Power
**Power** can be seen as one's ability to make what they want happen in the world. Our *weight* in the world and our systems.

### Traits
- Doesn't have to be explicit (doesn't have to be named and labeled)
- Not individual (groups can have power) it can be shared
- Doesn't have to be used intentionally can still hard without trying
- Not a single axis can have power in some domains and not others
- Reinforcing one kind give others
- Doesn't have to be actively used (privilege)

### Relation to Technology
We have make tools of power. For example **scaling** technology help people with power already. Like for example factory robots hurt small companies who can't afford them but help more powerful rich companies. Developing technology can **entrench** power and make statures unable to change. Like for example with *Compass*. Technology can be restricted to large powerful companies and this mean technology can make these companies even more powerful.

Note: *Power amplification* can also be used to give regular people more power and make the world more fair. Giving regular people power has made things possible that weren't before. Technology can also give people more power like with disabilities etc.
