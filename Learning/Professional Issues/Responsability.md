# Responsibility
What is *responsibility*? We are talking about how **accountable** individuals or organizations are for actions in the world. So a guard is responsive for letting or not letting break-ins take place. They have a general *responsibility* to spend their time working towards their *responsibility*. It is not responsible for guard to have their eyes closed for example. **Responsibility** assigns roles to people in society.

##### Traits of Responsibility
- **Not explicit** - In many cases *responsibility* isn't explicit and is instead of getting a benefit from it we may benefit from being in a society that does that kind of thing.
- **Not a choice** in many cases we don't get a choice in being responsible for instance if we watch an event happen we may have a responsibility to tell others.
- **Not specific** - doesn't have to be a role can instead just be the kind of things we do as being part of a society.

##### Factors in Responsibility
*Responsibility* is variable you either are or you aren't responsibly but many factors can weight up for and against it.
- **Power** - A large part of what gives us *responsibility* is out power to help out.
- **Cost to you** - It also depends on the "cost to you" for example it you may not have a responsibility to do something if it may hurt you. 
- **Knowledge** - this also affects responsibility in many cases you can't be responsible for something you don't know about. In many cases however people will *claim lack of knowledge* to get out of responsibility.

##### Shared Responsibility
With more people we are less inclined to act responsibly as we assume someone else will take up the responsibility. This leads to the **bystander effect** where people are less likely to help other in crowded environments. Many things are the *responsibility* of many people and problems require many people to work together to solve. In these larger cases we may have a *responsibility* to take part in the solution as each of us alone will not solve it but that doesn't mean we shouldn't work together.

### Responsibility in Ethical Tech
We can look at the different stake holder and their responsibility:

##### Consumers
Consumers have a lot of power in many tech fields for example demanding changes to apps.  Equally we may have little power to change larger companies where us *consumers* cannot effectively opt out or protest. Consumers also don't have as much **knowledge** of how to solve problems called by tech.

##### Subjects
This is people who don't choose to use a technology but someone else uses it one them. For example we are all subjects in how the police choose to use tech. It can be very hard for these *subjects* to change these things. The *knowledge* of this group is also by default very low and therefore it is even harder to see problems. This makes this group not very *reasonable*.

##### Devs and Vendors
This is the people making the tech. They have the power to create or not create some tech. Although there is cost to them in terms of job security and livelihood. The *knowledge* is also high making them more responsible to change it.

##### Researchers/Research funders
This is a wider category that isn't making tech but building the tools that allow tech to come about. For example releasing research can affect many people. The cost may be low to change research but it can be high in the case that you career is invested in a technology.
