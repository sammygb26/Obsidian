Previously we defined a group to be **cyclic** if there is an element $a$ in $G$ such that $G=\{a^n\mid n\in Z\}$. Such an element $a$ is called a **generator** of $G$. We write '$G$ is a *cyclic* group generated by $a$' as $G=\langle a\rangle$.

##### Examples
The set of integer $Z$ under ordinary addition is cyclic. Both $1$ and $-1$ are generators as $$Z=\{1^n\mid n\in Z\}=\{n\mid n\in Z\}$$ Where we interpret $1^n=1n$ as the group operation is addition.

Then $Z_n=\{1,2,\dots,n-1\}$ for $n\ge1$ is a cyclic group under addition modulo $n$. Again $1$ and $n-1$ are generators for this group ($-1=n-1$ under modulo $n$). But these may not be the only generators depending on the $n$ given.

For example $Z_8=\langle 1\rangle=\langle3\rangle=\langle5\rangle=\langle7\rangle$. An example of how this is verified is $$\langle3\rangle=\{3,3+3,3+3+3\}=\{3,6,1,4,7,2,5,0\}$$But $2$ is not a generator with $\langle2\rangle=\{2,4,6,0\}\neq Z_8$.

Another example if $U(10)=\{1,3,7,9\}=\{3^0,3^1,3^3,3^2\}$ but equally this can be found for $7$.

##### Nonexample
All the above examples **are** cyclic but we may as if there are *non-cyclic* groups. For example $U(8)=\{1,3,5,7\}$ is a non-cyclic group. With $\langle1\rangle=\{1\}$, $\langle3\rangle=\{3,1\}$, $\langle 5\rangle=\{5,1\}$ and $\langle 7\rangle=\{7,1\}$. So $U(8)\neq\langle a\rangle$ for all $a$ in $U(8)$.

### 4.1 Criterion for $a^i=a^j$
![[Pasted image 20230109191243.png]]

In the infinite case the recuring application of $a$ never returns to $e$ and so there can never in general be a sequence of $a$ which bring you back to some previous element. Hence $a^i=a^j$ iff $i=j$. Then in the finite case we can use the divisor algorithm to take of $n$s from each power. Hence they are only equal if their remainders are the same when the divisor algorithm is used with $r$. This implies

Then a special case when $j=0$ is

### Relationship between $|ab|$ and $|a||b|$
![[Pasted image 20230109191147.png]]

This comes from corollary two above. If $ab=ba$ with $|a|=n$ and $|b|=m$ then we have $(ab)^{mn}=(a^n)^m(b^m)^n=e^me^n=e$. Hence $|ab|$ must divide $mn$ at least since $(ab)^{mn}=e$.

![[Pasted image 20230109191808.png]]

The important point of the above theorem is that multiplication in $\langle a\rangle$ is essential the same as addition modulo $n$. That is if $(i+j)\mod n=k$ then $a^ia^j=a^{i+j}=a^k$. This means no matter the group $G$ and the generator $a$, multiplication in $\langle a\rangle$ is the same as addition in $Z_n$ when $|a|=n$. Then if $a$'s order is infinite it is the same as addition in $Z$ with no modular arithmetic as $a^ia^j=a^{i+j}$. Hence the cyclic groups $Z_n$ and $Z$ are prototype cyclic groups for all cyclic groups. Infact **algebraists** say there is essentially only one cyclic group of each order.

There are many sets of the form $\{a^n\mid n\in Z\}$ but we operate on them in the same way (addition of exponents possibly with modulation). Algebraists don't care about what the elements are only the algebraic properties of the set.

### 4.2 $\langle a^k\rangle=\langle a^{\text{gdc}(n,k)}\rangle$ and $|a^k|=n/\text{gdc(n,k)}$
![[Pasted image 20230109192723.png]]

We will write $d=\text{gdc}(n,k)$ and let $k=dr$. Since $a^k=(a^d)^r$, we have by closure that $\langle a^k\rangle\subseteq\langle a^d\rangle$. By the greatest common divisor theorem there are integers $s$ and $t$ such that $d=sn+tk$. So $a^d=a^{ns+kt}=(a^n)^sa^{kt}=a^{kt}=(a^k)^t\in\langle a^k\rangle$. 

$\langle a^k\rangle=\langle a^{\text{gdc}(n,k)}\rangle$ is proves as $(a^d)^{n/d}=a^n=e$ hence $|a^d|\le n/d$. Then for any $i<n/d$ we have $a^{di}\neq e$ by definition of $|a|$ since $di<n$. Now we know $|a^d|=n/d$ as was to be shown.

The $\text{gdc}(n,k)$ can be seen as the smallest possible unit of $a$ that can be recovered from $a^k$. The $\text{gdc}$ is the smallest number that can be composed of $n$ and $k$ by the gdc theorem. The gdc is therefore a minimal skip number and hence why we divide by it in theorem 4.2.

##### Example
We start with $|a|=30$ so the cyclic group $|\langle a\rangle|=30$. We want to to find $\langle a^{26}\rangle,\langle a^{17}\rangle,\langle a^{18}\rangle$ as well as their orders. So $\text{gdc}(26,30)=2$ so $\langle a^{26}\rangle=\langle a^2\rangle=\{e,a,a^2,a^3,\dots,a^{28}\}$ and so $|a^{26}|=15$. Then $\text{gdc}(17,30)=1$ so $\langle a^{17}\langle=\langle a\rangle$. Then $\text{gdc}(18,30)=6$ so $\langle a^{18}\rangle=\langle a^6\rangle=\{a^6, a^{12}, a^{18},a^{24}\}$.

#### C3 Generators of Finite Cyclic Groups

#### C4 Generators of $Z_n$
![[Pasted image 20230111175143.png]]

This also means once we have found one generator of a set then all other generators of that same set can be found in that set. They are found as the elements whose power is relatively prime with the order of the generator. For example this can be used to find all generators of $U(50)$ but of course this is much simpler than through direct calculation.

**Note:** 4.2 and corollaries only apply to elements of finite order.

## Classification of Subgroups of Cyclic Groups
This theorem allows us how many subgroups a finite cyclic group has and how to find them.

### Fundamental Theorem of Cyclic Groups
![[Pasted image 20230111180021.png]]

So cyclic group's subgroups are cyclic. Then there is one for each divisor of $n=|a|$ and no more. So for example if $|a|=30$ then the subgroups of $\langle a\rangle$ are

![[Pasted image 20230111182349.png]]

#### Subgroups of $Z_n$
![[Pasted image 20230111182528.png]]

This come from theorem 4.3 taking the group to be $Z_n$ and $a=1$. So as above we get

![[Pasted image 20230111182628.png]]

##### Example
So to find the generators of order 9 in $Z_{36}$, we observe that $36/9=4$ so the only group is $\langle 4\rangle$. The other generators are $4j$ when $\text{gdc}(j,9)=1$. So 

![[Pasted image 20230111183117.png]]

In general if we have $|a|=n$ then the generator for the subgroup of order $d$ is $a^{n/d}$ where $d$ is a divisor of $n$. Then all the other generators for this group are of the form $(a^{n/d})^j$ where $j\in U(d)$.

So combining 4.2 and 4.3 we can count the number of element of each order ($n$) in a finite cyclic group. This will be the number of positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. We us the **Euler phi function** here as $\phi(n)=|U(n)|$.

![[Pasted image 20230111183957.png]]

### 4.4 Number of Elements of Each Order in a Cyclic Group
![[Pasted image 20230111184229.png]]

This means that say for $Z_8$, $Z_{640}$ and $Z_{80000}$ each have $\phi(8)=4$ elements of order 8. This makes sense as even though the larger sets have more elements the order of the whole group gains factors meaning less numbers have the same gdc. This doesn't hold for all $Z_{i8}$ however.

#### Number of Elements of Order $d$ in a finite group
![[Pasted image 20230111184746.png]]

This is as for however generators for the subset of order $d$ come in groups of size $\phi(d)$.

This theorem may be hard to sure as $\phi$ has no formula and counting the umber of positive integers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$ is hard. However $\phi$ has some useful properties that make is easy to calculate.

1. If $p$ is prime then $\phi(p^n)=p^np^{n-1}$
2. Then for relatively prim $m$ and $n$, $\phi(mn)=\phi(m)\phi(n$).

### Subgroup Lattice
The relationships among the subgroups of a group can be illustrated with a **subgroup lattice** of the group. This is a diagram that includes all subgroups of the group and connects a subgroup $H$ at one level to a subgroup $K$ at a higher level. There are many ways to draw this but one way is to label each subgroup with the minimal set which generates. No matter how you draw it the connects are the same.
