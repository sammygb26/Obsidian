How might we define the symmetries of a square? #flashcard #CAA #IntroductionToGroups
	We might consider the motions we can take of the set of points in a square that would move all points in the set while maintaining all their distances finally leaving the set the same as before. For a square this can be explored by labeling all the corners then considering rotations and reflections that maintain the "outline" of said square.

What are all the motions that can be taken maintaining he symmetry of a square? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	If we consider all motions getting the square into all possible configurations and we consider only the outcome of the operations then we have 8
		1) $R_0$ doing nothing
		2) $R_{90}$ rotation $90\degree$ (counterclockwise)
		3) $R_{180}$ rotation of $180\degree$
		4) $R_{270}$ rotation of $280\degree$
		5) $H$ flip about the horizontal axis (origin is the center of the square)
		6) $V$ flip about th vertical axis
		7) $D$ flip about the main diagonal (top left to bottom right)
		8) $D'$ flip about the other diagonal

Why does the composition of the group of motions on a square give another motion? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	Each motion defines how to reach some square preserving state and there is one motion for each state. This means that for any composition of motions we still reach some state which could be reached by a single motion. Hence the composition of any two motions is another motion.

What is the group of symmetries of a square called? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	Is called $D_4$ or the *dihedral group of order 8*.

How is an operational table or Caley table defined? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	To reveal the structure of some group we take the horizontal labels to be the operation performed first then the second column to be the operation performed second. Then the entry is defined to be the operation equivalent to the composition of the horizontal label first with the vertical second.

What does it mean for a group to be non-commutative? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	A group is non-commutative if for some operations $A$ and $B$ in the group $AB\neq BA$ (also said as non-Albian). The reverse of this for every $A$ and $B$ in the group $AB=BA$ we say is commutative (Albian).

What are th dihedral groups? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	For any regular $n$-gon ($n\ge3$). We corresponding symmetric group (with reelections and rotations) is denotes $D_n$ and is called the *dihedral group of order 2n*. This is also called the "group of symmetries of a regular n-gon"

How is a plane symmetry and symmetric group for a figure defined? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	A **plane symmetry** on a figure $F$ in a plane is a function form the plan to itself that carries $F$ onto $F$ and preserves distances. The **symmetric group** of a plan figure is that set of all symmetries of the figure.

How is a rotation defined for a plane? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	A rotation of a plane about a point is a symmetry of the plane that maintains said point in the same place.

---
How is a refection about a line defined? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	A reflection about a line can be seen as a transformation taking every point on the line to the same position and every other line is in a different position. This define the line form $q$ to $q'$ to be a perpendicular bisector to the line.

---
What is the connection between reflection and rotation? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	A reflection in 2D about a line can be through of as a $180\degree$ rotation about that same line when the figure is consider in 3D.

---
How are the cyclic groups defined? #flashcard #CAA #Preliminaries 
	The cyclic rotation group of order $n$ denotes $\langle R_{360/n}\rangle$ in 2D. This define the symmetries of an object that has some rotational symmetries but is not reflectively symmetric.
