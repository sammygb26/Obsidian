What is the definition of a binary operation? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	If $G$ is a set. A **binary operation** on $G$ is a function that assigns each ordered pair of elements of $G$ an element of $G$.

---
What is closure in terms of a binary operation? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	I binary operation maps ordered pairs of elements from some set $G$. If this mapping goes only to elements in $G$ it has **closure**.

---
What is the definition of a group? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	If $G$ is a set together with a binary operation (usually called multiplication) that assigns to each ordered pair $(a,b)$o elements of $G$ an element of $G$ denotes $ab$. We say $G$ is a **group** under this operation of the following three properties are satisfied:
		1. **Associativity**: the operation is associative; that is, $(ab)c=a(bc)$ for all $a,b,c$ in $G$.
		2. **Identity**: there is an element $e$ (called the identity) in $G$ such that $ae=ea=a$ in $G$.
		3. **Inverses** for each element $a$ in $G$, there is an element $b$ in $G$ (called an inverse of $a$) such that $ab=ba=e$.

When is a group Abelian? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	A group is **abelian** if for every pair of elements $a$ and $b$, $ab=ba$. Then it is **non-Abelian** if there exists some pair of elements $a$ and $B$ and $ab\neq ba$.

What is the U(n) group? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	This is the group of integers less than $n$ that are relatively prime to $n$. So some $a\in U(n)$ has the property $\text{gdc}(a,n)=1$. This is a **group** under regular integer **multiplication** modulo $n$.

---
What is the group Z_n? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	This is the set of all positive integers less than $n$ and is a **group** under regular binary addition modulo $n$.

---
What is the special linear group? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	Denoted $\text{SF}(d, S)$ for dimension $d$ special linear group over the set $S$. It the set of all $d\times d$ matrices $A$ elements in $S$ which also have the property $\det A=1$.

---
What is a general linear group? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	Denoted $\text{GF}(d,s)$ is the set of all matrices that are $d\times d$.

---
What is the uniqueness of identity theorem for groups? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	This means that for groups there is only one identity.

---
What does cancelation mean for group relations? #flashcard #CAA #Groups
	This means that if some element can be canceled if it appears on the right in two equal expressions or the left in two equal expressions.

---
What does the uniqueness of inverses mean? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	This means that in a group there is only one inverse for each element. The element $b$ only have the inverse $b^{-1}$. $b^{-1}$ in **unique**.

---
What is the socks shoes property? #flashcard #CAA #Groups 
	This is the property that $(ab)^{-1}=b^{-1}a^{-1}$.
