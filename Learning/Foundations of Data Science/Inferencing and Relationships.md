x# Inferencing and Relationships
We can compare groups of values in our data and see a correlation or pattern. What we want to know is if this correlation means also **causation**. 

**Correlation** -> Two variables are correlated when knowing the value of one gives you information about the other

**Causation** -> Two variables are causally related where changing one value affects the vale of the other variable.

## Correlation Coefficient r
The **correction coefficient** is a measure of the linear correlation of two variables. It measure how well the fit a straight line.
$$
r_{xy}=\frac{S{xy}}{S_x S_y}
$$
That is the covariance of x and y divided by the variance in x times the variance in y.

## Selection Bias 
This is when the sample doesn’t represent reality. For example in WWII the planes who came back with holes and the engines had the least number of hole. Does this mean we need less Armor on engines? No the reason there were less bullet holes there is because they didn’t make it back. Another example is longevity in populations with the average age of a student dying being 20 compared to 74 for a chocolate maker. So why is being a student so dangerous. It isn’t it is just the case that students aren’t as old as other professions.

## Establishing Causation    
An example of how to do this is the miasmas theory vs germ theory. With miasma being bad air and germ theory being dirty water. How can we establish causation then. The idea is to run an experiment for example in this chart you can see how the bars representing people dying from cholera you can run an experiment to see if all the deaths are connected to the bond street pump

So the input is whether they went to the bond pump and against if they died. To make this true you have to have it so that each case only differs in the variable you are manipulating. You want to keep all other variables equal to make sure other variables aren’t changing the outcome. So in this experiment instead of focusing on large areas where the different water operators did business you would focus on the small area they both supply in. But you also have to test the variable to make sure it does change the outcome. So in this case the pump was closed to complete the test.

## Confounding Variable        
This is a variable that is corelated with the one you are testing for but may also affect the outcome variable. This way it can make it seam as though there is a causation when there isn’t.
