What are the coefficients for linear regression when we consider that are calculated form a sample? #flashcard #FDS #LinearRegressionInference
	The coefficients themselves are estimators for the true coefficients. The value we actually gave where therefore point estimators. We can use the bootstrap method to get a distribution for them

What is the estimator for standard error in the regression coefficients? #flashcard #FDS #LinearRegressionInference 
	For the standard error in the coefficients will be for $\hat\beta_1$ the standard deviation of the samples values over the sum of the x squared differences. We can then use t-critical values to get out range of values.

What is the idea behind the principle of least squares derivation for the coefficients? #flashcard #FDS #LinearRegressionInference 
	The idea is to maximize the probability of observing the out results given our coefficients. This eventually simplifies from probability to simple minimizing least squares.
