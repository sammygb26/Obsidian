What is an estimator? #flashcard #FDS #Estimation
	We use an estimator to guess at a true value relating to some statistic (the statistic we are estimating). We will have a point estimator which gives some exact value and a confidence interval which tells us about other likely values. The estimator itself is a random variable that relates to the true value.

What is the bias of an estimator? #flashcard #FDS #Estimation 
	The bias of an estimator is the different between the estimated value of the estimator (as it is a distribution) and the true value for the population.

---
What is the variance of the estimator?  #flashcard #FDS #Estimation 
	This is the same as the variance of a random variable and describes how the likely hood of different true values weights up against out estimation. That is how much our estimator spreads out.

---
What is the mean squared error of an estimator?  #flashcard #FDS #Estimation 
	The mean squared error of an estimator is a measure of how well it estimates out value and is equal to variance plus bias squared. This is the same as mean squared error for some prediction technique like linear regression.

---
What is the standard error of an estimator?  #flashcard #FDS #Estimation 
	The standard error of an estimator is analogous to the standard deviation of a distribution. It measures how much values spread out from the mean.

How can we get the standard error for some estimator?  #flashcard #FDS #Estimation 
	The standard error for some estimator is the standard deviation of the true population over the square root of the number of sample for the estimator (or times the number of samples squared if our estimator is a sum).
