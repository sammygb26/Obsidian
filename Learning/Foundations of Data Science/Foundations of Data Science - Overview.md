# Foundations of Data Science
Data Science is combining the large amount of data we have with the computing power we now have to analyze it. To be able to be a good Data Scientist we have to understand how to construct stories with data and to show truth. We use tool like programming to do this.

The pipeline for data science is therefore **_ask an interesting question_**, **_get the data_**, **_explore the data_**, **_model the data,_** and **_communicate and visualize the results of this_**.
