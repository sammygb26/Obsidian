# Functional Safety
*Functional Safety* is part of *standards* and can be found in many different standards that attempt to maintain functional safety. We perform a *functional safety* assessment to determine whether a product meets standard and performance requirement. If you don't meet these functional safety standards for example an insurer may not insure you this will make your company liable to damage caused by your systems *Compliance* with functional safety is also needed to make your product legal and meet regulations and customer requirements.

**Definition** -> "part of the overall safety relating to EUC (equipment under control) and the EUS control system that depends on the correct functioning of the E/E/PE safety-related systems and their risk reduction measures".

*Functional safety* needs to be applies to many system for example a oil plan must meet safety standards and EUC must be maintained by the control system, a car production line must meet safety standards maintained by a control system, fun-fair ride must also meet standards again controlled somewhere...

Functional safety doesn't relate to a single field, it relates to how equipment is controlled by a given control system, hence the control system must meet certain standards.
