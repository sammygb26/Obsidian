# Justification
Justification is used to make sure you are right in doing something. So you need an argument to show that this is the case. 
We need to **resolve premise and conclusions**. So we take a conclusions and premises (reason we believe the conclusion) we then just want to connect the two.

*Note: can be counter arguments*

We want to **unfold you ideas in a natural order** we lead the reader down the argument.

*So we have to unfold are arguments in a natural way, write once -> rewrite improve order*

We need to **start from reliable premises** we need evidence to support our premises otherwise our argument stands on shaky ground.

For example maintenance cost, software cost etc.

We need to be **concrete and concise**, we don't want to add flowery language we need details and not opinions, facts and not hearsay.

We want to **build on substance not overtone** we don't want to add lots of tone and language. We want instead substance and facts to support the argument.

We want to use **consistent terms**, this is so we don't get confused. This helps make is worse structures. Bellow is a poor example

So we need to **resolve premises and conclusions**, **unfold our idea is a natural way**, **start from reliable premises**, **be concrete and concise**, **build on substance not overtone** and **use consistent terms**.
