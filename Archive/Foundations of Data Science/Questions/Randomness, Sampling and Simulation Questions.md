What are statistical simulations used for?  #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation
	Statistical simulations are used to find distributions for complex random variables without deriving their distribution through mathematics. We can estimate the true shape by using synthetic values derived in a way that ensures they follow the distribution we really want.

What is the difference between sampling with and without replacement? #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation 
	This comes up when sampling a population of values if we replace then after we have taken a value we allow it to be taken again when we resample. Without we do not do this.

What is a sample of convenience and how can it be overcome? #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation 
	This is when we take a sample in some easy way but the way we take it influences the distribution of values among the sample to be different form the population that is it doesn't represent it. We can use stratified sampling to overcome this where we weight samples to artificially inflate any underrepresented group. We have to identify the groups and their true mix in the population to do this.

How can the number of sample change the distribution of a estimator? #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation 
	With larger number of variables we get a more accurate estimator but also a different shape. This will also depend on the shape of the population we are sampling for example a uniform population will have a different shape for a mean distribution aswell as their variance distribution. As the number of samples increases the estimator will becomes more normal and have a smaller variance.

What is the central limit theorem? #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation 
	The central limit theorem means that a standardized estimator as the number of sample increases will converge to a normal distribution.

What is the law of large numbers? #flashcard #FDS #RandomnessSamplingSimulation 
	This means that as the number of samples in a sample increases the average value of a the sample will tend to the population average.
