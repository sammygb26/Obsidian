# Scraping
**Scraping** is a way of getting data. We can get data with APIs (Applications Programming Interface) where we can use a prebuilt set of functions developed by companies to access heir services. RSS (Rich Site Summary) are summaries frequently updated by online content for example new related sights or blogs. Then **Web Scraping** using software, scrips or by-hand extracting data from a website from the HTML files (often in tables in these files).

Part of collection is parsing the data into a nice structure we can analyze.

## Ethical Web Scraping
We need to try to use public APIs if available. Not use all the bandwidth of a website and not stop others from using it. We can share data if we ensure those we share it with also follow the rules from the API. Respect content right and don't pass the data of as your own. If we also write our own code we should identify ourselves and tell people what we are doing. We should also give back when we can to the services we take from. We also need to value the data we hold.
