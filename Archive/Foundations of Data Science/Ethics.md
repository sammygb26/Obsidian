# Ethics
The problem is data science is very powerful and influential we need a way to make sure we are doing the right thing and not hurting anyone for this we use **Ethics**. Guidelines and best practices are worked out for use of data is the responsibility of data scientists to follow this. This comes down to **privacy** and **rights**.

## Privacy
People have a right to privacy and may wish not to be identified in data. We can **anonymize** data to get around this but care must be taken to ensure **de-anonymization** can happen and peoples private information can't get out.

## EU GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)
Under the EU GDPR people have the right to be informed (know their data is being gathered), of access (look at what is gathered), of rectification (to change data that is wrong), to be forgotten, portability (having data sent to other companies), to restrict access (control who has access do your data).

## Bias
A phenomenon that occurs when an algorithm produces results that are systemically prejudiced due too simplistic/erroneous assumptions in the machine learning process. Bias can be problematic when it comes from aspects of human identity and culture. Machine learning can be embedded with bias from the training data.
