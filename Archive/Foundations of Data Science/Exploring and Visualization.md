# Exploratory Data Analysis and Communication
It is important to explore data to find interesting trends and to communicate this well to people so they know for themselves. **Visualization** is used to communicate and present data, it can also help us **explore** data and help us to find truth.

## Visualizing Variables
Visualization of data will depend on the types of data used. But also the number of variables being compared, like **univariate**, **bivariate** and **multivariate**.

**Numerical (quantitive) Continuous** -> These are numbers like weight and distance that have infinite possibilities.
**Numerical (quantitive) Discrete** -> These are still number but only in fixed amounts like number of times something has happed or number of days.
**Categorical Ordinal** -> These are values that make up a category but have some order think days of the weeks, months or ranks.
**Pure Categorical** -> These are simple different values rather than having any order they are unrelated, like favorite movie.

## Histograms
These are used to show the distribution of some variable. The space of variables is split into bins the height of a bin is then dependent on the number of entries with values in that bin.

Here A is skewed to the right and B is skewed to the left. This is described by the mode and the mean.

## Scatterplots
This is used to visualize the way two variables interact an dhow one influences the other. This is a **trend** and they can be seen in scatter plots like the one bellow.

## Box plots
Box plots are used to show the distribution of a variable within different categories.

The parts of the box plot are show bellow

## Scale distortions
Scale distortions can be used to lie about trends in data or make them seam bigger than they are. The lie factor describes how much this is the case 
$$
\textrm{Lie Factor}=\frac{\textrm{Size of effect showin in graphic}}{\textrm{Size of effect in data}}=\frac{|\textrm{second value - first value}|}{\textrm{first value}}
$$

## Pre-attentive Features
These are patters our brains pick out with little effort so can help us understand data quickly.

## Color Blindness
It can be important to avoid certain color combinations such as red and green since a large fraction of the population will have a hard time with these colors due to **color blindness** of which there are many types.
